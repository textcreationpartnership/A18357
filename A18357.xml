            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8070:7"/>not to excuſe the matter, as if <hi>Epimenides</hi> call'd them lyars for this onely, becauſe they affirm'd that they could ſhew the ſepulchre of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whom both he and the reſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did conceiue to be immortall. This ſhift ſmells of the ſame dye with a Sophiſme vſed in Logicians. The <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> are alwayes lyars; but <hi>Epimenides</hi> was a <hi>Cretian</hi> which ſaid this; therefore <hi>Epimenides</hi> lyed, and ſo by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is falſe, that the <hi>Cretians</hi> are alwayes lyars; for as in this Syllogiſme, a fallacy is committed in arguing from meere particulars, the <hi>major,</hi> that the <hi>Cretians</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lyars, being but equipollent to this; that many, or a greater part are lyars, out of which route, <hi>Epimenides</hi> might well be exempted; ſo in the other caption of <hi>Eude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's,</hi> what lets, that <hi>Epimenides</hi> ſaying might bee true in part, though not in this; that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was immortall; yet in this; that the <hi>Cretians</hi> are <hi>alwayes lyars, euill beaſts, ſlow bellyes;</hi> which is all that our Apoſtle doth quote, <hi>Cretes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt teſtes, nec fingunt omnes Cretes.</hi> A pretty world it is with the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that as heretofore they haue put vs to maintaine the authority of the Scriptures aboue the Church, ſo now we muſt defend the truth of them againſt a <hi>Cretian.</hi> But <hi>Eudemon</hi> reaſoning againſt ſo manifeſt a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, argues, that either his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen haue not yet left off their old quality, or elſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the refin'd deciſions of their order touching lyes &amp; equivocations, an officious lye for ones Country is helde currant ware, though the credite of an Apoſtle ſuffer by it. But let's leaue <hi>Eudemon</hi> &amp; his Countrymen as condemn'd by the Sentence of S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, beſides an whole jury of Proverbs pack'd againſt them, <hi>Cretizare, Cretizare cum Cretenſi, Cretenſis cum Aegineta, Cretenſis neſcit mare,</hi> all which giue no better language then the lye to the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The points which I ſhall deſire you to conſider in this accuſation of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> are chiefly <hi>two. Firſt,</hi> his <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8070:7"/>ingenuity</hi> in receiuing and approuing the truth, though breath'd from the lippes of a prophane <hi>Cretian,</hi> where he rejects not the pearle becauſe it was encloſ'd in a wooden casket, nor diſdaines the fruit becauſe it was ſeru'd vp in an earthen diſh; but rather the more admires it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to <hi>Titus</hi> and theſe <hi>Cretians,</hi> to be taſted by them alſo. This was farre from the daintineſſe of many in our age, which thinke no inſtructions availeable or of force, but ſuch as proceede from men, of whoſe inward calling they are perſwaded, as if the efficacy of the Word depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the ſanctity of the deliuerer. Hence growes that loathing amongſt ſome of their Paſtors &amp; their doctrine, that they follow thoſe teachers, not whom God by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling appointed them, but who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they chooſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. They pretend as ſtrict an obſervation of the Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth almoſt as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> onely to heare whom they fancy; they can convert the <hi>Sabaoth dayes journey,</hi> to ſpite the Pope, from <hi>two Italian miles,</hi> to <hi>two high Germane.</hi> True it is, that as the <hi>bels</hi> which hung in the <hi>Veſtments</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> were intermingled with <hi>Pomgranates,</hi> ſo God loueth not a ſound without fruit, &amp; exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plary piety is a ſecond Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; nay, to ſay the truth, there is not a figure in Rhetoricke more potent then the good opinion conceiu'd of the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, in which reſpect both <hi>Ariſt.</hi> &amp; <hi>Cicero,</hi> requir'd it euen in a ciuill Oratour: But this argues not the truth, vttered by a prophane perſon, of imperfection, but the ſtomacks of moſt hearers to be of weak diſgeſtion. The <hi>gift</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> where the Apoſtles were confirm'd in the Miniſtery of the word, is not <hi>graetia juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis,</hi> a grace of juſtification; but <hi>gratia aedificationis,</hi> a grace of edification, not <hi>gratia gratu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faciens,</hi> as the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> ſay, that is, a peculiar grace giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſalvation of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> a grace giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſalvation of others. The <hi>Carpenters</hi> (you know) builded the <hi>Arke,</hi> &amp; yet were not ſav'd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: &amp; the <hi>Tyrians</hi> &amp; <hi>Sydonians</hi> furniſhed <hi>Salomon</hi> with materials for the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8070:8"/>and were neuertheleſſe themſelues without the covenant: So this witneſſe of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> converts to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of winning the <hi>Cretians</hi> to true ſpeaking, which yet could not ſaue <hi>Epimenides</hi> from venting a notorious lye, and that in the very place it ſelfe touching <hi>Iupiter's</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. But what imports it whether the Phyſitian doe heale himſelfe, ſo long as he preſcribes vs wholeſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke; or whether the priſon key be in the hands of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, ſo long as it open's the wicket, and ſets vs free from thraldome and bondage?</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to bee conſidered in this accuſation, is the Chriſtian liberty, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> aſſumeth in inſerting the witneſſe of a <hi>prophane</hi> Writer, and that with no ſmall commendations, into the bowels of <hi>Canonicall</hi> Scripture. In the verſe preceeding, he cited indeed one of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, but the manner of his citing of him is there ſomewhat more doubtfull; here in my Text, ſaying, <hi>this witneſſe is true,</hi> the caſe is more clear'd; and he declares himſelfe that he vſeth it as a confirmation or proofe, not to bee refuted by him, but to refute the gainſaying of the <hi>Cretians</hi> by it. But what will ſome ſay, Is <hi>S. Paul</hi> come to quote <hi>Poets?</hi> why? he hath taught vs, <hi>that the Scriptures are ſufficient, to teach, to inſtruct, to confirme, to reproue, that the man of God may be perfect in euery good worke:</hi> how is it then that hee takes vp the defence of an vnhallowed Poeme, and turnes <hi>Patron</hi> to the aſſertion of an <hi>Ethnicke</hi> Writer? Nay, hee which profeſs'd his comming not to bee in the wiſedome of men, doth he borrow this furniture from Philoſophers, and giue roome to ſtrangers to lodge vnder the roofe of God's Sanctuary? But the Fathers doe vpon this place note the prudence of the Apoſtle, who to the <hi>Cretians</hi> vſ'd the authority of a <hi>Cretian,</hi> giuing them their food in due ſeaſon, and applying Phyſicke to the temper of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>becomming all things to all men, vnto the Iew a Iew, vnto the Gentile a Gentile, that he might winne them vnto Chriſt.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8070:8"/>For what more cleareneſſe can there bee, then to make men parties in the proofe, judges in their owne cauſe, and witneſſes againſt themſelues? how can one better confute the <hi>Iew,</hi> then by <hi>Paraphraſt's,</hi> diſperſt as well in their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> as in their <hi>Talmud?</hi> How ſhould one reaſon better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Epicure</hi> and <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> then by bringing the world and creatures therein for witneſſe, or theſe are the records which they louebeſt, and moſt beleeue, and from which they are loatheſt to depart? How can one ſoundlyer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> then by the things that euery man readeth in his owne nature, which hee findes inſcrib'd in his heart, and hath beene vttered by naturall men? Thus God himſelfe doth oftentimes ſuite his manner of calling men, to their condition of life; The <hi>Wiſe men</hi> which were <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> he call'd by a <hi>ſtarre, Peter</hi> a <hi>fiſherman</hi> by a draught of <hi>fiſhes, Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi> of the Sect of the <hi>Stoickes</hi> or <hi>Epicures,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſuppoſes, by a <hi>ſentence</hi> vrg'd by <hi>S. Paul at Athens out of Aratus,</hi> and here is the ſame enterpriſ'd againſt the prophane <hi>Cretians,</hi> from a prophane Prophet of their owne, <hi>Epimenides.</hi> Certainely, ſeeing it hath pleaſ'd our Apoſtle to quote a ſaying of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Secretary, and to inſert it into his writings as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine which he would employ for the converſion of the <hi>Cretians</hi> vnto godlineſſe, and ſince wee ſee the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to haue ſweetned the <hi>waters of curſed Iericho,</hi> and to haue made wholeſome drinke of them for the children of the Prophets, as alſo to haue quickned and made fertile theſe wilde ſtockes, and to tranſplant them, to bud and bring forth fruits of righteouſneſſe and faith in theſe <hi>Cretians;</hi> I cannot here by the way but condemne them which thinke either the ſtudy, or citing of humane writers in divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, to be altogether vnlawfull. The maine prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe citations happens from a wilfull blindnes of a perverſe generation, which hath not after ſo many yeares tutouring, learned to diſtinguiſh between the lawfull vſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8070:9"/>and the abuſe of a thing: I confeſſe as it was more in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the Primitiue Church, then now it is, to cite ſome Authors; ſo was there then another reaſon for the ſame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now there is, the <hi>Fathers</hi> being then to deale with <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi> &amp; ſometimes with learned &amp; judicious <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as was the caſe of <hi>S. Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and here happily in <hi>Crete,</hi> in which <hi>Cydon</hi> might then as well yeeld an <hi>Eude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> as now, howſoeuer the whole <hi>Iſland</hi> was famous in this, ſaith <hi>Solinus,</hi> that it firſt gaue lawes to letters before all others, &amp; therefore the example of theſe men can yeeld no ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pretence to any now-a-dayes, to make preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word to be but a <hi>rapſody</hi> or <hi>medly</hi> of <hi>Greeke</hi> &amp; <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Poets; <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith truly, that humane eruditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (too much of it) is but <hi>vinum inebrians,</hi> wine that makes a man drunke: <hi>inflans, non nutriens; implens, non adificans;</hi> rather glutting, then nouriſhing; and puffing vp, then edifying, &amp; to ſuch as make their auditours to ſurfet of ſuch raw and immature fruits, I may ſay with S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to <hi>Euſtochius, Quid cum Pſalterio Horatius, cum Evangeliſtis Maro, cum Apoſtolis Cicero;</hi> what makes <hi>Horace</hi> with the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> what <hi>Virgil</hi> with the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> what <hi>Cicero</hi> with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles?</hi> Nay, we all know how vnſeemely a thing it is for a ſubject to ſit on the ſame Throne with his Prince, or an handmaid to beare equall rule in the houſe with her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe; or the dog (as our Sauiour termes theſe forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) to poſſeſſe the roome and place of the Children: Yet let mee ſay thus much; that the ſubject may vſher his Prince, the ſervant attend his Maſter, &amp; the handmaide her Miſtreſſe. There is yet an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the world, which ſaith in his heart, there is no God, to him we may ſend <hi>Cicero,</hi> a man as ignorant of the Scripture, as hee incredulous of it, which ſhall certifie him of the conſent of all Nations in the acknowledging a divine power. There are of the <hi>Sect</hi> of the <hi>Epicures,</hi> which bid vs eate, &amp; drink, &amp; ſport, for after death there is neither Heauen nor Hell, to theſe wee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8070:9"/>may oppoſe <hi>Homer</hi> if blind, yet ſeeing farther then they perhaps into the ſtate of men deceaſ'd. There are of the <hi>Stoickes</hi> brood remaining which minde not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, but referre all things to deſtiny, to theſe the <hi>Orator</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> that <hi>Atticke Moſes</hi> will reply, that God's providence extendeth it ſelfe vnto all things, and that there is not a mote (as <hi>Democritus</hi>) ſo ſmall which yet hee doth not minde and order. Is this now to make the pulpit a Philoſopher's Schoole, or rather the Philoſopher's Schoole a foote-ſtoole vnto the pulpit, and an handmaid vnto divinity, to proceede better in the neceſſary worke? I cannot tell what others may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, but me-thinkes as often as wee heare an <hi>Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> reſolue vs morrally into the chaos of vice of which wee conſiſt, this meditation ſhould bud in the heart of every good Chriſtian; Good GOD are thoſe peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times to enſue in our dayes which thou foretold'ſt by thy Apoſtles, or do the mindes of men decay with the whole fabricke of the world, that thus in the firſt principle of our catechiſmes, <hi>Heathens</hi> ſhould informe vs of our miſery, and the <hi>Diſciples of nature</hi> prooue greater <hi>Maſters</hi> then the <hi>Schollers of the Goſpell?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, beleeue it (belooued) theſe are thoſe <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> which will riſe vp in judgement againſt you, theſe thoſe <hi>Queenes of the South</hi> which will conndemne you, for they had not thoſe lights which wee haue, and yet they ſaw farre more, then many of vs doe. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth <hi>Hierome</hi> obſerue vpon the <hi>firſt of Daniel,</hi> that if you turne over the bookes of the Philoſophers tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching manners, you ſhall finde part of the veſſels of the houſe of God there; in <hi>Plato</hi> that was the maker of the world, in <hi>Zeno</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Stoickes</hi> you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover hell, and the immortality of the ſoule, although they mixing the truth with much falſehoode may be ſayd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8070:10"/>to haue taken not all the veſſels of Gods houſe, but ſome onely, and thoſe not whole neither, but crack'd and broken.

Certainely had <hi>Paul</hi> conſtrued this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to bee a ſubject worthy of a combate, hee would not haue branded a whole nation with ſuch a vice, or at leaſt thought to haue wrought ſoundneſſe in mens faith by ſo vnſeaſonable an inſtrument? Wee which challenge farre higher places in Chriſts ſchoole, then theſe raw converts, muſt acknowledge our non-proficiency, if wee be more offended with others telling vs of our faults, then with our ſelues, for being faulty, ſeing it is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to be, then to be called ſo; inaſmuch as wordes are but aery images of things, and to make the moſt of it, a biting enemy is but a cholericke phyſitian that tells one his diſeaſe in his anger.

Yes, hee may rightly be blam'd for not being in the fields, which ought to be there, ſhuts himſelfe vp, and is willing to abide there ſtill, and he is worthy to be chid which comes not out of a pit though he cannot, if he by his owne negligence brake the ladder, vvhich ſhould helpe him out. Now man caſt's himſelfe into this pit, and ſhuts himſelfe in this priſon, herein he is to be rebuked; he willingly would abide there ſtill, herein hee is to be rebuked; he loſt by his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault the meanes to eſcape thence, I meane to avoide an occurrent ſinne, and herein he is to be rebuked. But they reply, you ſhew indeede in this, a juſtice in reproving, but by denying a power to the will of vſing or rejecting theſe reproofes, you deny the profit or neceſſity of them.

It had beene little acceptable in God's ſight for them to haue riſen early, and late to haue taken reſt, had it not been to a good end, and right vſe, but labour it was which they aim'd at, and patience it was with which they waited for it.

The comming of theſe men to market to be hired, the patient expectation of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the willing vndertaking of paines impoſed vpon them, was a thing (no doubt) to God well pleaſing, but that immaculate lambe, which is the true Paſtor, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of our Soules, hath concluded all vnder ſinne that he might haue mercy on all; when he is pleaſed to aſke a why? what man is he that can anſwer one to a thouſand?

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8070:21"/>which lead vnto life, &amp; bee miſ-led into the broad way which leadeth vnto deſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing therefore that a Chriſtian is on all ſides ſo encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred with the wiles of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than &amp;c inticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the world, well &amp; wary muſt he bee, leſt by ſtanding idlely or careleſſely with theſe labourers when oportunities are offer'd, he miſſe &amp; faile of the ſcope he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. So farre were the Saints in the old Teſtament fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omitting any oportunity whereby they might practiſe their piety, that on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſide they ſought out waies, &amp; as it were plotted how to do good. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. lookes vp &amp; ſees three men, and what doth he? not looke aſide like the mizers of our daies, nor ſtand expecting whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould implore harbour of him, though the Sunne was as then at the higheſt, &amp; the time of the day by reaſon of heate vnſeaſonable to travaile in, but hee runs to meete them, leſt they ſhould overpaſſe him, bowes to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that they might not deny him, and petitions them if hee hath found favour in their ſight, that they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to turne in vnto him.

Why theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came humble ſuiters vnto their gueſts, &amp; not their gueſts vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? All the parcels of holy writ are full of ſuch exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the zeale of <hi>David</hi> for the houſe of the Lord, <hi>Iehoas</hi> his owne care in purging the Temple, <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; out of ſeaſon, &amp; <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> ſolitary night-walkes about deſolate Hieruſalem, what are they but liuely pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of that forwardnes &amp; forecaſt, though not ſpecially ſtirr'd vp by others, which every Chriſtian ſhould aſſume himſelfe in the worke of the vineyard? I could here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vnto you the example of our Saviour Chriſt, whoſe compaſſion commonly then moſt appeared when it was lead implored. Litle did Hieruſalem or Sion think of him,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8070:22"/>when he weeps for it, or the ſoule-ſicke Iew ſeeke for him as the Phiſitian, when he ſought nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſalue him, ſinfull man which never had the grace either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his owne miſery or to beg God's mercy, Chriſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had need of, of himſelfe came downe to cure his infirmity; and his mortall enemies which abandoned him, &amp; had loſt the right of their inheritance, thirty-three yeares and more voluntarily fights hee with the divell, world, &amp; death, that he might purchaſe it a new for them.</p>
            <p>Theſe (beleued) and the like examples ſhould moue vs to bethinke our ſelues of thoſe free and voluntary actions of piety which God requires at our hands, and whilſt wee are here abiding in this <hi>Naioth</hi> as in a Source whence knowledge is to be derived into the barren places of this land, let vs not ſtand idle, or be too beetle-ſighted in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the good opportunities which are heere preſented vnto vs to do good to others: &amp; though wee are not call'd to any ſpeciall charge; yet imagine we may not, that in the meane ſeaſon God challengeth no mites at our hands to be freely beſtowed on the hungry ſoules which dwell by vs, &amp; which periſh often for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſmalleſt cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes that fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our tables; you know whoſe voice it was, <hi>Nunquid ego cuſtos fratris mei?</hi> am I my brothers keeper?

If wee oppreſſe the fatherleſſe, or detaine the right of the poore, <hi>mortui ſumus non otioſi,</hi> we ſtand not idle, ſayth <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> but are then dead; but though wee doe not this, yet if wee ſeeke not out the poore and giue voluntarily vntothem, <hi>ſtamus otioſi,</hi> ſayth hee, wee ſtand
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8070:22"/>idle. This is the market place where the husband-man expecteth to finde labourers, and it is almoſt the twelfth houre with ſome that they haue ſtood idle therein, ſhall they ſay with theſe in my text, <hi>quia nemo nos conduxit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man hath hired vs: why then belike the vineyard in this parable is not the Church of God, whereſoeuer the brambles of ſinne are to be cut off; but ſome fatte benefice: nor the penny which the husband-man agrees to giue them, the crowne of glory, which they muſt not receiue vntill the evening; but ſome worldly promotion, which they muſt harpe after in the meane time. They indeede which are poſſeſt of a paſtorall charge, haue a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vocation to imploy their talent in that place, which talent if they put vp in a napkin, as ſome doe, they ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes then wee, yet we haue a generall vocation beſides, by vertue whereof in thoſe things which beare a relation vnto Chriſt our head, we haue all an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt one in another, and in this reſpect, we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to admoniſh one another: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. beſides, wee are parts of the ſame body, and haue wee no fellow-fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling when other members are wounded, or doe feſter? we doe fight the ſame battaile, &amp; thinke wee it endangers vs nothing, when others breake their rankes, or forſake their ſtations? Wee are the flocke of the ſame ſheepheard, and feede in the ſame paſtures, and ſhall wee conceiue our ſelues free from all perill, when wee ſee others tainted or infected? if any by preferring a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> before a prompt and learned <hi>Ezra,</hi> doe hinder thee ſomewhat from an ordinary performance of the workes of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, this thing will God require at their hands, but if theſe neglect their care of vs, ſhall we wholly neglect our care of Gods flocke? God graunt there be none here of whom, as the wiſeman ſaid of worldlings, that God gaue them riches, but hee gaue them not the heart to vſe them, ſo I may ſay of them, that God hath given them learning, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8070:23"/>&amp; other bleſſings from aboue, and hath not given them the heart to vſe them. It was farre otherwiſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) in the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> of whom wee reade, that ſo ſoone as God had but touch't his lips with a coale from his altar, his heart was ſtraight inflamed to bee ſet on worke, and when the Houſe of Iſrael, and men of Iudah, which were the vineyard which the Lord of hoſtes had planted, and of whom he looked for judgement and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, when they had brought forth wilde grapes, the ſinnes of crying and oppreſſion, and God had ſaid, who ſhall goe vp for vs, and whom ſhall I ſend? <hi>Eſay makes no delayes but cries, ſend mee.</hi> Let vs reaſon together (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) wee are the vineyard of the Lord as was Iudah and Iſrael, what could he haue done more for them, then hee hath done for vs? and hath not <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>Baaliſme</hi> infected yet many an angle of our land, as it did that of Iudah, and to roote out this, <hi>God ſaith, whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> hath not ſimony and ſenſeleſneſſe of religion invaded the richer ſort, and to correct theſe, God ſaith daily, whom ſhall I ſend? Flattery, raines it not in pallaces, falſe ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in cities, and ignorance in cottages? and to reforme theſe, <hi>God ſaith once and againe, whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> Every miniſter is a watchman, and as an officious meſſenger, is to ſay in theſe caſes, ſend me. Now when God ſends vs out into the wayes, and wills vs to bid as many as we can find, of poore and diſtreſſed vnto the marriage, can it ſuffice vs to preach in high places onely, or kings palaces? This is with the people to ſeeke Chriſt, not ſo much for ought elſe, as for the loaues they eate, and which filled them; or With <hi>Iudas,</hi> to follow Chriſt rather for his bagge, then for his doctrine Rouſe vp your ſelues therefore (beloued) the harveſt is great, and good labourers in many places are deficient, knowledge decayes in ſome parts, and how ſhould it be repaired but by you? the neceſſity you ſee is vrgent, the opportunities apparent, the reward eminent,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8070:23"/>and therefore why ſtand you here? which is the <hi>place</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and commeth next to be handled. <hi>Why ſtand you here?</hi> The place here reprehended by the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, in all probability, the market-place, and indeed the market-place, if we may ſtand vpon the letter, is no fit place for the labourers of the vineyard to ſtand in. But to paſſe from the letter to the ſenſe; the market (ſaith one) is the world, <hi>vbi omnia ſunt venalia, maxime verò animae,</hi> where all things are bought and ſold, eſpecially mens ſoules; Lord to ſee how cheape the devill buyes them! for how litle pleaſure, how litle gaine or honour? the ſhrewd merchants of our dayes, who will ſticke at a penny when they trade with their neighbours, vvill not ſtand for their ſoules when they are to barter with the devill. But yet as our beſt interpreters doe obſerue, the vineyard being taken more particularly for the Church, the market may ſignifie any place out of Church, and not amiſſe, for God forbid, that markets ſhould be kept either in Churches, or Church matters, ſince it pleaſed our Saviour to whip both buyers and ſellers out of the Church: but this I note onely by the way. The labourers of the vineyard being ſo ſharply rebuked by the husband-man for ſtanding (here) that is, in a place wherein their labour lay not, &amp; whereof they were not labourers, doth direct vs more vſefully to this obſervation:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a Chriſtians labour ſhould chiefely be imployed in that place, whereof his calling makes him a labourer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is eaſie to be confirm'd by ſundry places of holy writ, for firſt we finde that the Levites were watchmen, but yet by <hi>Moſes</hi> law, as in their proper place, they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially were to watch in the Tabernacle or the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Num.</hi> 10. Iſrael muſt fight the Lords battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Midia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſo that all obſerue the place which their <hi>Gideon</hi> appointes them: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7. And the Elders at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> are commanded to watch and take heede, but it muſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8070:24"/>be to the flocke, over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers: <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Iacob,</hi> as wee reade <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. when hee once vndertooke to bee his vncles ſheepheard, the homelines of the taske could not daunt him, nor the vnkindnes of churliſh <hi>Laban</hi> diminiſh his vigilancy, but that for 20 yeares together, though the drought conſum'd him in the day, and the froſt by night, ſo that for care, his ſleepe departed from him, he ſtill abode with his flocke in the field.</p>
            <p>A good example (beloved) for vs miniſters, which either now haue, or may hereafter haue a flocke of Chriſts committed to our cuſtody, to teach vs with what care &amp; diligence we ſhould alwayes attend on it. It is a vineyard vvherein the enemy will ſow weedes to plucke downe the vines, if vve be not vvatchfull as vvas this Patriarch: it is a campe on all ſides oppugned by Satans ſtratagems, ſo that if vve but budge from our ſtation, hee'le imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly finde entrance: it is a flocke vvhich vve muſt feed not <hi>verbo</hi> onely, but <hi>exemplo</hi> by example likewiſe, as we are taught 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. and therefore if through our abſence any thereof doe erre or goe aſtray, at our hands God vvill require it againe. Woe therefore, ſaith <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> to the idle ſheepheard that leaueth the flocke, the ſword ſhall bee vpon his arme, and his right eye ſhall bee vtterly darkened. But vvhat (vvill ſome object) muſt the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard then be alwayes attending his flocke, the labourer alwayes labouring in the vineyard? this is an hard ſaying, and vvho is able to beare it? Neither am I ignorant vvhat hath befallen to many, vvho at the firſt haue beene ſo vehement in ſpeaking againſt any toleration in this kind, that afterwards having more feelingly look't into the caſe haue changed their mindes: a notable example vvhereof vve may haue in <hi>Cajeran,</hi> vvhom <hi>Ambroſius Cathari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in his apologie againſt Dominicus a Soto,</hi> produceth to proue the lawfulnes of this act, for that hee having
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8070:24"/>once in his writings inveighed moſt bitterly againſt it, &amp; afterwards being made Cardinall, accepted of a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, and reſided not at it, and ſo refuted his writings with his example. To come briefely therefore to the point, I dare not be ſo peremptorie againſt the practiſe of our Church as ſome are, plaine it is that this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reſiding is <hi>praeceptum affirmativum,</hi> an affirmatiue precept, as <hi>Eliſeus, Valentia,</hi> with others doe obſerue, and therefore you know it binds not <hi>ſempe,</hi> or <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> it muſt not be laid in the ballance ſtript from thoſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry materiall circumſtances which ſhould giue it waight. I graunt therefore that there may be certaine caſes which, though one be a labourer of this vineyard, or a paſtor of this flocke, yet may excuſe his abſence for a time. As <hi>firſt intrinſecall impediments,</hi> ſuch as is the ſicknes of the body, for if the place be vnfit for recouery, it were hard heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes in a flocke to barre the phyſitian of their ſoules (as <hi>Moſconius</hi> notes) the lawfull meanes to recover the health of his body; and therefore leaving not his place vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed vntill his recovery, I take, the husband-man excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this man though hee bee a labourer of the vineyard from his cenſure of ſtanding here. <hi>Secondly, there may be extrinſecall impediments,</hi> which may admit of a diſpenſation of abſence, as perſecution, ſo that the two rules which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auſtine requireth in his</hi> 18 <hi>epiſtle to Honoratus</hi> bee obſerv'd; <hi>the firſt is, that the perſecution bee not generall but perſonall:</hi> not generall, that is of all paſtours, or of the flocke as well as paſtours, for if he then leaue his ſtation, he is compared by our Saviour to an hireling, who ſeeth the wolfe comming, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſheepe, and the wolfe catcheth them, and ſcattereth the ſheepe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. and this perſecution of cleargy and lay-people together, is likened by that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the equall danger of marriners and merchants in the ſame ſhippe in a great tempeſt, now God
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8070:25"/>forbid (ſaith he) that the marriners, or ſpecially the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the ſhippe leaving his paſſengers behind, ſhould ſaue himſelfe by a boate, or by ſwimming, and commit the vnwealdy veſſell to the mercy of the vnmercifull waues. But the perſecution muſt bee perſonall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per not to paſtours onely, but to that paſtour or ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours only, and in this caſe <hi>Elias fled from Ieſabell:</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19. <hi>Peter</hi> left the Church of Hieruſalem to eſcape <hi>Herods</hi> furie: <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>Paul</hi> left the Church of Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, when ſome particularly ſought to kill him: <hi>Act.</hi> 9. and Chriſt wiſh't his diſciples when they were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one citie, to flie into another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>The ſecond rule which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auſtine ſets downe, is that the neceſſary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the paſtour which is fled, bee ſupplied by others:</hi> and therefore, <hi>Paul</hi> when he fled the perſecutours, left not Damaſcus voide of a neceſſary miniſterie, nor <hi>Athanaſius</hi> left the Church of Alexandria deſtitute of other teachers, when hee fled from <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperour, as the ſame Father well noteth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I deny not but that a labourer from his ſpeciall place, or a paſtour from his particular flocke may be abſent, and yet not come vnder the Husband-mans laſh of <hi>Why ſtand you here:</hi> and this may be <hi>qualitate negotij,</hi> when the buſineſſe about which hee goeth, is to the profite either of the vniverſall Church, or of ſome particular. <hi>Naclantius, Campegius, Moſconius</hi> and others which write vpon this ſubject, do reduce to this title the going to generall or particular Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and helping to eſtabliſh other Churches, &amp; the like, in which caſes they agree that a paſtour may leaue his flocke for a time, ſo that the time be not very long, and the place not vnprovided of a ſufficient ſubſtitute: for ſo we reade of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> had committed the <hi>Church of Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Tytus</hi> who was Biſhop of <hi>Crete,</hi> how the one was ſent to eſtabliſh the Church in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> &amp; the other both promiſed to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> &amp; alſo vpon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8070:25"/>an occaſion ſent for to come to Rome: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. but yet ſo, that neither <hi>Titus</hi> his flocke were left vnprovided of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtructors which before he had ordained there, nor <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> well noteth, <hi>wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted</hi> a <hi>Tychicus,</hi> which was ſent vnto them to ſupply <hi>Timothie's</hi> roome. But theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exceptions may be applyed to all Churches in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, there are ſome other alleadged by our men which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our Church of England more particularly: for <hi>firſt,</hi> there is a liberty of abſence graunted to ſome, that their knowledge may be increaſed in the Vniverſity, &amp; their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by that meanes, be made afterwards the more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to others, leſt the houſes of great men ſhould want that daily exerciſe of religion, wherein their example availeth as much, yea many times peradventure more then the lawes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>elues, with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort: <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to others which are men of quality, that as their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are in weight for the publicke good, ſo likewiſe their rewardes &amp; encouragements ſhould be the more, leſt it might here be verified, which we reade in <hi>the firſt of Iob, that the oxen ſhould be only plowing, and the aſſes feeding.</hi> But becauſe it is controverſed with no ſmall fervency on both ſides, what are the true limits, without which it is not lawfull to ſtray in this point; &amp; for as much as it cannot be imagined, that all circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances are ſo perſpicuouſly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scriptures concerning this, as that moe doubtes, like <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads, ſhall notriſe vp a new to continue the fight; for mine own part I could wiſh, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would but firſt practise on all parts that which may be certainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the word of God. Fourethings we find plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in the Scriptures concerning the duty of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he is to imploy his talent to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Church, leſt the grace beſtowed vpon him be in vaine: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that hee hath a particular calling to take heed to, &amp; to feed that flocke of God, ouer which the Holy Ghoſt hath made him ouerſeer: <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that his hirelings negligence ſhall not excuſe him,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8070:26"/>if the wicked be not warned from his way, but that the bloud of that man God will require at his hands which is the true watchman, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that the feeding of his flocke is to be preferr'd before any worldly reſpect, be it either honour or wealth; and therefore we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take the ouerſight thereof, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. and indeede our lawes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended, that the outward pompe of the Church ſhould bee advanced with any prejudice to the inward growth of it, as ſome thinke, who take the Church to be of the Spaniſh humour, &amp; could be content to haue it's belly pinch't, rather then it's backe vngarded. Theſe things, I take, may be ſufficiently ſtrengthned by many texts in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ: if any will pretend that they can practiſe theſe by ſubſtitutes, or can ſupply in effect by proxies what theſe challenge, let others take vp the firſt ſtone, I ſhould bee here ſilent: for mine owne part I came not hither to lay any aſpertion of negligence vpon thoſe reverend pillars of our Church, whoſe aſſiduous and frequent viſiting of their flockes, beſides other worthy labours conſumed in higher places, might ſerue to brande our rurall ſluggards with perpetuall ignominy: only for thoſe, whoſe flocke, (as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> termes it) haue ſcarce ſeene their face in the fleſh, nor others in the pulpit; &amp; which abuſing the ſcope of the ſtatute, provided no doubt to a good end, thinke they may goe ſafely therein, as farre as the very letter of the law will giue them leaue; I know not what to judge; vnleſſe they are perſwaded, that before Gods tribunall, they ſhall bee proceeded againſt by the common law, or elſe, that they hope they ſhall bee allowed a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to plead their caſe at that day. In the meane time, leaving the deciding of the queſtion to others, let vs apply to our ſelues but thoſe foure points which before I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and conſider therein the duties which God exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth at our hands: <hi>the firſt,</hi> which concernes the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our talent, yeelds a caveat both to thoſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

The laſt point</hi> which intimates the high reſpect wee

O beloued, I feare mee if many pried but into their owne hearts, they ſhould find the ſtate of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomewhat altered from that which they propoſe vnto the world; it would not bee, whether they might diſpence with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be abſent from the place where their particular calling lyes, vpon caſe of ſickneſſe or perſecution, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of their neighbour Churches, or aſſiſting of Synods aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled; or laſtly, (which ſeemes to be M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Fathers and Brethren, I know not what to ſay, if theſe carnall motiues are ſufficient to make any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this caſe excuſable: hath not Chriſt taught vs that a good ſheepeheard will lay downe, not his goods or his wealth, (for that were a ſmall matter) but even
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8070:27"/>his owne life for his flocke. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10? <hi>Mathew</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded more in wealth had be ſtill fate at the receipt of cuſtome, and not followed our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> might more freely haue enjoyed himſelfe had hee ſtill continued at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> But <hi>Mathew</hi> thou hadſt beene poore to Chriſt, hadſt thou not made thy ſelfe poore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: and <hi>Paul</hi> had beene hard hearted to vs, had hee not beene cruell to himſelfe: the world had loſt an example, wee had loſt our leſſon, the Church had loſt an inſtructer, and Chriſt an Apoſtle. The good Fathers (I am aſhamed to ſpeake it) <hi>Tertullian</hi> to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and <hi>Auſtine</hi> to <hi>Honoratus</hi> made more ſcruple of leauing their flockes, when cruell perſecutours fought their liues, then many now adayes doe to abide with them when they are oppugned onely by their carnall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; they prodigall of their liues, and bloud charged the enemy in open fight, and caſt him out, reſcuing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and ſubduing the nations of the world to Chriſt and his Goſpell, and ſhall wee when the field is wonne forſake our colours, bee ſlacke inpurſuite, and giue the adverſary leaue once more to make a re-entry? But the time bids mee bee breefe, I will leaue therefore the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther application heereof vnto your owne conſciences, and ſo I come to the time reprehended in my texra <hi>all the day, Why ſtand yet here all the day idle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhewed you the Sunne before in his riſing, when to you (beloued) yet hanging vpon this our mothers breaſts my adviſe was, that you would not ſtand idle there, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not oportunities of entring into the vineyard; my next leſſon was for thoſe which had taken earneſt and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hired, that they would not ſtand <hi>(here)</hi> idle out of their proper place the vineyard, &amp; loe, to them the Sunne ſtood as it were in the midſt of the firmament;but now we muſt behold him not <hi>ſtationary</hi> as at the prayer of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> nor <hi>retrograde</hi> as in the dyall of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but going downe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8070:28"/>and the glorious lampes of heaven whiſome obſcured by his brighter beames, almoſt ready to make their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: now was the time or never for the husband-man to beſtirre himſelfe, now muſt the labourers do ſomething to earne their penny; poore men it was the 11. <hi>houre</hi> of the day, and they in the ſame caſe as at the firſt. O but let not the Sunne go downe in this manner, worke the worke of the husbandman <hi>dum dies eſt,</hi> whilſt it is yet day, the night will come when no man can worke, then hee which hath ſtood all the day idle, ſhall looſe all the dayes hire, the the crowne of eternall glory. Many good conclusions might from hence bee deduced; as firſt how dangerous a thing it is for a man to deferre his entrance into a new courſe of life: <hi>haec parabola</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>tollit deſperationem, non docet praeſumptionem,</hi> this parable taketh away deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not teacheth preſumption, for hee which at the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

But theſe I paſſe over, as being by others often beate vpon: wherefore I deſire that you would returne a litle backward with mee, and call to minde, how Interpreters for the moſt part do agree, that the ſeverall howers and parts of the day, do delineate vnto vs in this parable nothing elſe, but the ſeverall ſeaſons of of mans life, and how that the market place doth paint out any place out of the Church: that therefore the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould brand all the day or parts of mans life ſpent <hi>(here)</hi> or out of the Church with this blot of idleneſſe, I inferre:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all our life appeares idle in Gods ſight, which is ſpent before wee truly are inſerted or engrafted into the body of the Church.</hi>

            <p>As the Church is diſtinguiſhed into viſible &amp; inviſible, ſo may a man be ſaid to be actually inſerted either into the viſible alone, which requireth nothing but an externall profeſſion of the true faith; or into the inviſible, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the profeſſion, craues the inward ſpirit of adoption.

What ſhall wee ſay (beloued) is it likely that God is ſo rigide in his cenſures, that he will not ſpare to reproue euen actions meritorious? his mercy was wont to be aboue all his works, and will hee now make well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruings the ſubject of his high diſpleaſure? God forbid! let him be juſt, and theſe labourers, how glorious ſoeuer their actions, ſinners; and being ſinners, it followeth, that God which in the evening rewarded them aboue their merite, did now entertaine them without their merite; and that their works which after their calling into the Church appeared pleaſing, before this admiſſion appeared idle and vaine in themſelues: The reaſon is giuen by our Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. when he bids vs to make the tree good, and his fruit good; or the tree euill, and his fruit euill; for as is the tree, ſuch will be the fruit; the <hi>ſacrifice of the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or wicked, is an abomination vnto the Lord, Proverb.</hi> 15. and the Lord <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. cryes out to the Iewes which had forſaken him. <hi>Bring no more oblations in vaine, my ſoule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth your new Moones, and your appointed feaſte, they are a burthen vnto me, and I am weary to beare them;</hi> and againe in <hi>the 66.

            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:8070:29"/>
            <p>A point worth the conſidering by thoſe who hauing once beene freed from the bondage of Antichriſt, doe like <hi>Lot's</hi> wiſe looke backe againe towards <hi>Sodome,</hi> if not with a reſolution of returning, yet with a delight of beholding her painted outſide. Beloued, if wee acknowledge them to be none of the true Church, I may confidently pronounce their workes as they are in Gods ſight, vaine and idle. For <hi>Sodome</hi> will be <hi>Sodome</hi> and Antichriſt will bee Antichriſt; we cannot expect grapes of thornes, nor figges of thiſtles. <hi>Affirmatiuely</hi> I confeſſe I cannot conclude, this or that man doth outward good workes, therefore hee is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the true Church; for God onely who knoweth the heart of man, can truely judge of the goodneſſe of the worke; but <hi>negatiuely</hi> I may ſay, this man is no member of the true Church, therfore his life beit never ſo laborious in the eyes of men, yet in the ſight of God, with theſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in my Text, he ſtands alwayes idle. And indeede the huſbandman's argument ſo runnes. <hi>ſtatis hîc,</hi> you ſtand here out of the Church, <hi>ergo otioſe;</hi> pretend therefore what you liſt, defend your caſe how you can, you ſtand heere all the day idle. It hath beene a prepoſterous courſe therefore, as you may well obſerue, which the Ieſuites and Prieſts haue vſed, in ſeducing our Countrymen either at home or abroad, to winne them to their ſide, by ſhewing them the devotion of their religious men, the liberality of their Lay people, or the ſtrange outward holineſſe of both ſorts, at ſome times in the yeare; our men ſhould firſt, before they venture too farre vpon their workes, ſift the truth of their Church; and before they ſuffer ſhipwracke in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctickes, ſound the depth or their ſhallowes in their theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. For from the gliſtering of works to the verity of the Church, inference can be but probable at the moſt, &amp; often falſe; but from the corruption of doctrine, or from a nullity of the Church, to the nullity of good workes, the argument holdes alwayes ſtrong, and the concluſion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe acknowledgeth the former in his 5. <hi>booke de gratia &amp; libero arbitrio,</hi> and 10. <hi>chap:</hi> when he ſayth, <hi>Ex operibus ipſorum hominum qui nos docent, non poſce cognoſci doctrinam, cùm opera interna non videantur, externa autem ſunt communia vtriſque.</hi> The doctrine which men teach cannot be knowne by their workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their inward workes are not ſeene, and their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes are common to both ſides. The latter I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before, &amp; it needes not much amplifying; for if the roote be bitter, the fruit cannot be ſweet; and if the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be rotten, it cannot but be of ſmall performance. But to come more particularly vnto them, becauſe they ſeeme heerein to out-face vs: our men doc commonly giue <hi>three reaſons,</hi> wherefore the workes of thoſe which exiſt out of the true Church, can by no meanes be pleaſing in God's ſight; and ſhould I not too farre encroach vpon your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I could eaſily exemplifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Church of <hi>Rome; The firſt is,</hi> becauſe they proccede not from a true faith. &amp; alas! what is the faith of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Antichriſt hath not ſo ſhedde her hornes, as ſhe hath diminiſhed that true faith to which <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs, ſhee was once obedient, <hi>that faith was ſuch an one as came by hearing the word of God: Rom:</hi> 10: and was like that of <hi>Abraham's, by which he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not of the promiſes made vnto him, Gen.</hi> 15: ſo that her eyes were knowledge, &amp; her ſoule was a firme confidence in the merits of our Saviour; here you may ſee a ſtrange al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defining faith rather by ignorance, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge, &amp; telling vs, that all confidence in theſe caſes is plaine preſumption: wherfore <hi>Rome's</hi> faith being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both of ſight &amp; ſoule at once, can bee no more opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, it muſt needs be dead, &amp; profit them nothing. <hi>The</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>reaſon</hi> why the workes of thoſe which are not members of the true Church, are idle in God's ſight, is becauſe they are not done to a right end: well ſaid therfore <hi>S. Auſtin, Cùm facit homo aliquid vbi peccare non videtur, ſi non propter hoc

See how out of the mines of the Goſpell, Antichriſt labours to hew his throne, &amp; make the Articles of faith nothing but columnes of a Papall Empire. But theſe may ſeeme yet to be actions of State; let's ſee what each member doth in the cloſet of his ſoule: a man would thinke that betweene onesſelfe &amp; God there ſhould be plaine dealing found; yet behold, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there do they erre in their ſcope, &amp; rob God of his honour, rejecting him which is the way, &amp; ſtriuing through their owne workes to beat a path to the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> How art thou fallen <hi>Babylon</hi> that great City, and art become the habitation of divels! how haſt thou built thy fortreſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſands of humane wiſdome, refuſing the rock &amp; corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Chriſt Ieſus! But to be briefe, <hi>the</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>reaſon,</hi> why thoſe works are idle in God's ſight, which are done by men out of the true Church, is drawne <hi>à formali,</hi> becauſe the works many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their owne nature are groſſe ſins; &amp; indeed it is a matter worth the obſerving by all of vs, that thoſe fects which maintain not the truth of the Goſpel in purity &amp; ſincerity, are tainted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly beſides other errors, with the defending of ſome groſſe ſin or other, which diſplaies and add's ſuſpition to all the reſt: God in his providence detecting hypocriſie by ſome apparent iniquity. <hi>S.

It is not (I am perſwaded) either the wheele offortune, or the change of deſtiny, or the craft of the diuell, that brings the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of our Church to beleeue ſuch ſhamefull doctrines; but it is God in his divine providence which hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, euen there where the light of nature is moſt apparent, ſo to ſtumble, that the meaneſt of God's Elect whom he hath decreed to redeeme from the ſervitude of the Beaſt, by feeling the Law written in their hearts, to thwart and contradict thoſe ſtrange aſſertions, nay grow to a diſtruſt in the reſt, and by diſtruſting ſearch, and by ſearching finde the true way which leades vnto life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:8070:31"/>was that which firſt ſtirred vp <hi>Luther's</hi> generous ſpirit in <hi>Germanic,</hi> to make a farther inquirie into <hi>Babylon's</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and how that <hi>groſſe diſpenſation</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> for <hi>K.

There may be <hi>Balſecks,</hi> and <hi>Eudemons,</hi> amongſt them, to carpe at the actions of our men; wee againſt them need no ſuch libellers, the Pillars of their own Church haue in writing vented blaſphemies enough to brand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, &amp; their owne pennes in many countryes haue ſerued as juſt inſtruments of their confuſion. To come to an end; This Land hath ſeene with watery eyes; the ſtrumpet for many hundred of yeares together, ſitting ouer multitudes and nations, as ouer many waters; it hath beheld her, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying her ſelfe like a Monarch, &amp; carrying the kingdomes of the Earth in open triumph; let it ſuffice vs now, that the good Husbanndman CHRIST IESVS, at the 11. <hi>houre,</hi> at the end of the day of dayes, hath opened our eyes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne her fornications, that we might goe out of her; and hath redeemed vs from that market where before wee ſtood idle, at ſale amongſt her merchandiſes, by hyring vs out into the Vineyard of his Goſpell.

               <hi>becauſe,</hi> being a rationall particle, and here vſed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiue, ſo that whereas the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haue pleaded ignorance to excuſe their idolatry, the Apoſtle ſhewes them, that their ignorance was <hi>craſſa &amp; affectata,</hi> was groſſe and affected, ſuch as the Pope now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes enjoynes his ſubjects, and ſuch as by the tenures of Philoſophy doth augement rather then deminiſh an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: for beſides that to excuſe ignorance is required; firſt that it bee not gotten by mens owne fault, as theirs was by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; Secondly that they bewaile their owne ignorance, and acknowledge it, and deſire to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the ſpirit of God; Thirdly, that God bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiged by covenant to reſtore them to that light which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8070:33"/>they wilfully loſt: it is farther exacted that they make good vſe of that light of nature which is left them, and ſuffer it not groſſely to be extinguiſhed, in which the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> moſt of all offended. For what if they knew not God abſolutely? as <hi>Bellarmine in his fourth booke de gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiá &amp; lib. arb. &amp;c.</hi> Yet by the light of nature they knew there was a God, and that God ought to be worſhipped, though by their wilfull ignorance, they glorified him not as God: and ſo I come from Gods bountifull decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of himſelfe objected to the <hi>Gentiles;ſ</hi> to their groſſe neglect and contempt of the ſame detected in them both from the parts and the effects of it, but firſt of the parts, which come in the next place to bee handled, <hi>Gloria Deo denegata,</hi> they glorified him not as God, and <hi>Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Deo irrogata</hi> neither were thankefull.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> glorified not God as God, two manner of wayes, <hi>in the theorie,</hi> and <hi>in the practike;</hi> 1. <hi>in the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orie,</hi> to wit, in the doctrine of his eſſence. The <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetickes,</hi> as it appeares by <hi>Ariſtotle in the eighth of his Phyſickes, and firſt de Coelo,</hi> rob'd him of the creation of the world, which with motion they would haue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. The <hi>Stoickes</hi> tooke from him providence, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the events of things to deſtiny. Moſt of them deprived him of his vnity, Simplicity, immenſity, and power, by faining a number of Gods, which they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either to certaine nations or certaine offices, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations: thus they glorified him not as God. <hi>In the practicke</hi> part of their divinity, which concerned the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip of him, which S <hi>Paul</hi> well expreſſed <hi>in</hi> 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>verſe of this chapter,</hi> where hee ſayth, <hi>they changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and birds, and foure-footed beaſts, and creeping things.</hi> Some of them went lower even to plants and herbes, as if GOD could haue growne
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8070:34"/>in their gardens, with which the Poet derided the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians:</hi>

            </q>
            <p>So that though wee cannot deny in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> a good meaning and intention of glorifying God, yet how little acceptable to him is devotion not directed by true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, no where appeares better then in this example in my text of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Who could be more ſolicitous and forward in the worſhip of God then they? witneſſe the ſumptuous and magnificent Temples, the ſolemne feaſts and ſhewes, the continuall Sacrifices which they advanced in the honour of their ſuppoſititious deities: but as <hi>Auſtine vpon the</hi> 31. <hi>Pſalme</hi> alluding to ſuch blinde worſhippers as theſe, ſayth truely, that the ſwifteſt run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners beeing once out of the way become greateſt looſers, and that it were farre better to haue the ſhip guided by ſlacke and heavy marriners, then by a nimble and quicke pilot, who failing in his courſe, ſternes the veſſell with greater violence and much ſooner againſt the rockes: ſo queſtionleſſe it had beene leſſe to theſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> condemnation, if they had beene ſluggiſhly religious, then miſſing their marke to bee ſo zealouſly impious. Whence wee may learne, ſayth <hi>Beza,</hi> that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> did, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> GOD for one's ſcope, and not to bee grounded on ſound and ſure foundations, a good meaning is nothing avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable to excuſe one before GOD. To a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is not enough <hi>(ſay Divines)</hi> that the end bee good, vnleſſe other two properties bee preſent, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the worke, and Lawfullneſſe in the meanes. <hi>Saul</hi> had a good end when hee ſought to ſlay the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi> the text tell's vs, <hi>it was in his zeale to the Children of Iſraell and Iudah,</hi> nevertheleſſe <hi>it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8070:34"/>brought a famine vpon the land, and coſt the liues of his ſeuen ſonnes, becauſe the worke was bloudy:</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. The Scribes and the Phariſees, no doubt, had a good end in their laborious worſhip of God, but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells them, <hi>that in vaine did they worſhip him, becauſe they taught for doctrines, the commandements of men: Matt.</hi> 15.8. If the end be ſufficient to excuſe an action, then <hi>Paul</hi> ſinned not in that he perſecuted the Church of God, hee ſhould not haue ſaid, <hi>Accepi miſericordiam,</hi> I found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but rather <hi>Mercedem accepi,</hi> I receiued a reward, <hi>for he did it with zeale ignorantly:</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. If ſins, as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would haue them, may become veniall from the end, then we are vnjuſtly angry with the murtherers of the Apoſtles, for they were not only ignorant that it was a ſinne, but thought alſo moreover, that they did God good ſervice, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2. How is it then that this anſwere flies with ſuch plauſible paſſage in the world, that when igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition raigne together, neither the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is ſo carefull to learne, nor the learned to teach, nor the taught to remember; onely becauſe if the worſt come to the worſt, God will be merciful, in that things are done (as we ſay) <hi>with a good meaning.</hi> Alas (beloued) it had beene happy for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> if any ſuch plea could haue ſerv'd their turnes, <hi>compare but their Hecatombs with the Papiſts wafers, their Coloſſuſ's and golden ſtatues with theſe mens woodden or ſtonie poppets, their cuttings with others whippings,</hi> and you will ſay, that in the <hi>end</hi> they equalled, in many other things out-ſtripped Popery, yet this begg'd not their pardons: the <hi>Apoſtle tells vs that the wrath of God was revealed from heauen againſt them, becauſe though God they glorified,</hi> yet they ſay led in the maine matter, <hi>non vt Deum glorificarunt,</hi> they glorified him not as God. It is not therefore, we ſee, the glorious title of a profeſſion, not the antiquity, not the duration, not the conſpiration of a multitude in doctrine, or a religious purpoſe, which is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8070:35"/>warrant ſufficient for a Church to be true, ſo long as they firſt proue not their worſhip to bee free from idolatrie, their ceremonies from ſuperſtitions, their faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine not tainted with falſe conceivings of the deitie, but as they glorifie God in word, ſo really, <hi>vt Deum glorificant,</hi> they glorifie him as God.</p>
            <p>What is man if he be ſpoiled of reaſon, and ſenſes, and motions, ſo what is God, if hee bee ſuppoſed without his attributes? the <hi>Gentiles glorified him not as god,</hi> becauſe, as you heard, they rob'd him of his ſimplicity, immenſity, power and providence, and what doe the Papiſts when they impaire his <hi>wiſedome, grace, and glorie?</hi> They match traditions with the written word, therein injurious to the wiſedome of God; they mingle mans merits with the merits of Chriſt, therein injurious to the grace of God; they communicate divine worſhip to ſtocks and ſtones, therein injurious to the glory of God.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you briefely ſeene what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, in that <hi>they glorified not God of God;</hi> what he addes, <hi>that they were not thankefull,</hi> is but a part, if not the ſame in ſubſtance with the former, <hi>for they glorified him not as God,</hi> becauſe they ſtript him, beſides other attributes, of his workes of creation and providence; <hi>and they were not thankefull,</hi> becauſe they acknowledged not theſe things to bee his doings and handie worke. I will not therefore ſtand long vpon it, it requiring rather the comment of a gratefull convert, then of a curious interpreter. Onely let mee ſay, that if ingratitude be ſo highly condemned in the ſonnes of nature, it is much more to bee pittied in the children of grace; God might ſay to all, that he gaue them a ſoule to bee commander of their bodies, thinking that it being placed by him, would performe the ordinary reſpect of the worke to be at his command, and at the ſinke-ports of the body, would admit no enemie which ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the quiet of his government, hee might alleadge
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8070:35"/>farther, that he made them after his owne image, hoping that as <hi>Simile ſimili gaudet,</hi> their joy and contentation ſhould be to walke with him like <hi>Enoch,</hi> and not to goe like curſed <hi>Caine</hi> from his preſence, but never did ſuch arguments enter into the heart of any oratour or rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, to ſtirre the coales of gratitude and thankefulneſſe, as are converſant and familiar with the leaſt of Gods elect. If you pervſe the acts and monuments of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that he of rich did become poore, this is more then of a monarch to become a beggar, it was in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, of riches to become pouerty; but that hee ſo loved the vvorld, that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne to die, and be ſubject to death, even the death of the croſſe for vs, vvhen vve vvere yet his enemies; here eloquence <hi>may caſt in her mite, and like the poore widow, be liberall of what ſhee hath,</hi> but <hi>admiration</hi> and <hi>ſtupor</hi> muſt ſupply, what the <hi>tongue of men and Angels cannot vtter.</hi> There is therefore no ingratitude like the ingratitude of men to God, it is a contempt of him, whoſe benefits they cannot want, it is (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) <hi>ſuis contra Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> donis pugnare,</hi> to oppugne God with his own gifts; thus are they vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which acknowledge not Gods grace and protection, they which deny themſelues to be ſinners, or bragge of merits, they to whom God hath given the meanes of knowing him, as he did to theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they abuſe it by not hearkning vnto it, and living accordingly. I pray God it may not be imputed to vs, that in this reſpect wee are not thankefull, leſt wee participate of the puniſhments of theſe <hi>Gentiles, in becomming vaine in our imaginations, and having our fooliſh hearts darkened and obſcured.</hi> O that we could be taught by preſidents; and were not ſo bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, as not to learne vntill our owne experience bee our maſter. We know how heretofore the Eaſterne Churches contended for the Empire of learning &amp; knowledge with the whole world, where are now thoſe famous ſchooles
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8070:36"/>of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where thoſe ſeven renowned Churches of letter <hi>Aſia, where thoſe Colledges of Monkes diſperſ'd through Egypt and Syria, where their Baſill's, Nazianzens, Chryſoſtomes, Nyſſens, Cyrils?</hi> was not the vngratefull world thought vnworthy of theſe benefits, and therefore were thoſe lights extinguiſhed, thoſe candleſticks remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in their place nothing but darkeneſſe and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelfe, ſometimes the flow and luxury of wit, now containes nothing but extreame barbariſme and ſtupidity: in it <hi>Athens</hi> ſo glorious in times paſt for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, is now the temple of ignorance: as in reſpect of her temporall eſtate, ſhee hath loſt her beauty, pared her large dimenſions, depoſed her ſcepter wherewith ſhee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled and ſway ed all <hi>Greece;</hi> ſo in reſpect of her wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, knowledge, and skill in diſciplines, one might now ſeeke <hi>old Athens</hi> in <hi>new Athens,</hi> and not finde it. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God dealt with the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which being ſometimes the mirrour of the world, for fertility and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things, now for a teſtimony of puniſhment to the ingratefull inhabitants, he hath made it ſubject to many curſes, and eſpecially to that of barrennes; ſo hath he done to theſe nations, even plagued them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame wante of that knowledge, the abundance of which, their fathers did ſo wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; vnthankfully abuſe. Now (beloued) for this which hee hath done for our ſoules, what exacts he againe at the hands of vs his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? temples, or baſilikes, or marble pallaces for his Majeſtie to dwell in? Why, the earth is but his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, and the heaven of heavens is not able to containe him; or is it the bloud of bulls &amp; goates that he is delighted with? why, <hi>Mille ſui Siculis errant in montibus agni, all the beaſts of the forreſt are his, and ſo are the ſheepe vpon a thouſand mountaines.</hi> What tribute therefore is it which hee demands at our hands, what is the coyne that he requires to be paid with? Why, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8070:36"/>vs. <hi>Offer vnto the Lord the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</hi> Well might we feare leſt God ſhould haue requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome thing without vs, ſome thing in the houſe that the mothes had corrupted, ſome thing in the garner that the mice or vermine had conſumed, ſome thing in the field that the fox or wolfe had devoured; but he ſends vs to our ſelues, to our owne ward, to the inmoſt cloſet of the ſoule, which none can vnlocke but God onely, <hi>ara tua conſcientia,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And ſo I come from the parts of that <hi>contempt and neglect,</hi> which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhewed in the abuſe of that knowledge which God afforded them of himſelfe, in <hi>that they glorified him not as God, neither were thankefull;</hi> vnto the effects of the ſame, which were, as before I ſhewed you, <hi>a promptitude</hi> to invent and foſter vaine falſehoods, and <hi>a difficulty</hi> to credite the truth, but firſt of the <hi>proneneſſe</hi> they had to invent falſehoods, which commeth in the next place to bee treated of: <hi>but became vaine in their imaginations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonaventure on the</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

Wee perhaps would caſt about whence this puniſhment ſhould come; wee looke if our goods doe diminiſh, our ſtocke be impaired, our health be abated, our friends alienated; but alas! then had this maxime prov'd falſe in theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which had no cauſe to complaine of any ſuch diſaſters. But the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in their mindes, ſinne begot ſinne, errours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got errours, falſehoods begot falſehoods, and that, ſaith

               <hi>Durand,</hi> either by way of a <hi>finall cauſe,</hi> as one miſconceit being more plauſible vnto them then another, and to defend it, they invented others, in which kinde <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle in the firſt of his phyſ.</hi> ſaith truely, that <hi>vno abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do dato, ſequuntur mille:</hi> or elſe by way of an <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> the one habituating and diſpoſing them, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſee it experimented in lyars, to coyne other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with as great facility as the former.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8070:38"/>hiſtory</hi> confeſſeth, that they more were addicted to <hi>Ariſtotle, Theophraſtus,</hi> and <hi>Gallen,</hi> then to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> Whence grew the errours of <hi>Origen;</hi> but from this, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witneſſeth, that hee triumphed too much in the diſciplines of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented not himſelfe with the ſimplicity of the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> whence ſprang the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but from this, as <hi>Ambroſe on the</hi> 118. <hi>Pſalme obſerues,</hi> that they examined the divine generation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the grounds of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the vſe of this world? Thus by preferring their owne fancies and the ſandy foundation of humane wiſdome, before the ſure foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, they detain'd the truth in vnjuſtice, and <hi>became vaine in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The Fathers were (as <hi>Hiperius</hi> notes) for the moſt part <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and I know not if ſome of them may not elſe-where bee ſayd to reliſh of his precepts; certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if in any thing this age of ours may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with theirs, or elſe out-ſtrippe it, it is there where in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries in imitation of him, they drench the literall ſenſe too much with <hi>Allegories,</hi> as <hi>Andradius</hi> confeſſeth. S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> a man not too eaſily brought on to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the errours of his writings, amongſt thoſe few things which he doth retract, cenſures nothing ſo ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the miſtake of his youth in this kind, thinking it one of the greateſt ſinnes of his youth, that being carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way through an inconſiderate heate in his ſtudies of Scripture, hee adventured to interpret <hi>Abdias the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Allegorically,</hi> when as yet hee knew not the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recall meaning. I will not deny <hi>Allegories, Tropologies, Anagogies,</hi> as ſeverall applacations of one ſenſe, I will not deny more then one literall ſenſe, ſo that one be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the other; but to make all places, as the Papiſts would haue them, liable to as many ſenſes as wit is able to faigne, to draw the <hi>Pope's</hi> temporall ſword out of <hi>Peter's</hi> ſcabbard, or to fiſh for his vicaredge with <hi>Peter's</hi> net, this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8070:39"/>I leaue to the <hi>limbeckes of the Ieſuites,</hi> and aske if my text fits not right to them, that <hi>detaining the truth in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, they became vaine in their imaginations. Gerſon in his tract of Aſtrology</hi> tell's vs, that it was a cuſtome in the Vniverſity of <hi>Paris, that whoſoever was licenciated in the arts, ſhould take an oath to determine his Philoſophy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes alwayes agreeable to the Articles of faith, and that they would diſſolue the reaſons of the Philoſopher brought to the contrary;</hi> this was an excellent courſe to giue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the truth of the Scriptures, whilſt the dreames of Philoſophers kept it not in ſubjection; but hee which ſhall read the <hi>Sorbornes determinations in Theologie,</hi> would gueſſe that they had taken another oath to determine their queſtions in Divinity according to the precepts of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle's</hi> Philoſophy, and to diſſolue the authorities of the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> brought to the contrary. And may not wee here ſee my text well verified, that theſe Schoole-men detaining the trueth in vnrighteouſneſſe, firſt in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Scripture, by keeping the literall ſenſe from the view of the world, and diſtaſting thoſe <hi>(witneſſe the ſundry apologies of Caietan)</hi> who betooke themſelues to the literall ſenſe, as knowing inwardly that their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were not ſufficiently grounded, and that this kind of teaching opened a gappe vnto the world to diſcry their palpable abuſes; Secondly, in their poſitions rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt, as <hi>Daneus ſhewes, vpon Auſtine,</hi> afterwards as Popery more ſtrengthened it ſelfe, vpon <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and laſtly vpon the <hi>Tridentine Councell, and vncertaine tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that theſe I ſay ſhould not elſe-where in their vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable queſtions, and more ridiculous reſolutions, bee ſeene, as my text ſaye's, <hi>to become vaine in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi> perhaps their prayer for the dead, their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, vowes and ceremonies, may ſeeme to come from a fooliſh ignorant zeale, and herein though their imaginations cannot ſcape the laſh of <hi>vaine,</hi> yet they may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8070:39"/>be more pardonable. But to teach that colours may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without a ſubject, that a man may be at the ſame time at home in his bed and fighting againſt the Turkes, that one may equivocate and diſſemble to a good end, that one may do evill that good may come thereof, that the rights of lawes and nations do lye vnder the <hi>Popes</hi> girdle, why this Philoſophy was never taught by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> but as I gueſſe, when <hi>Hermolaus Barbarus</hi> queſtioned the divell for the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, hee added ſome further inſtructions to be delivered the Ieſuites touching theſe matters, for the defending their tenents. And truly I am perſwaded, that it is neither the wheele of fortune, nor chaine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, nor craft of Sathan, that hath brought our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to beleeue ſuch ſhamefull doctrines, but it is God in his divine providence which hath permitted them even there where the light of nature is moſt apparent ſo to ſtumble, not onely to giue the world a caveat, that thoſe which detaine the truth in vnjuſtice, <hi>ſhould become vaine and ridiculous in their imaginations,</hi> but alſo that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of his elect which hee hath decreed to redeeme from the ſervitude of the beaſt, by ſeeing the law written in their hearts, to thwart and contradict theſe vaine imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, may grow to a diſtruſt of the reſt, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting ſearch, and by ſearching finde out the true way which leadeth vnto life everlaſting. And thus having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the firſt effect of this abuſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bountifull declaration of God vnto vs by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which was a promptitude to invent vaine and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous falſehoods, <hi>they became vaine in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> I paſſe vnto the ſecond effect of the ſame, to wit, <hi>an indiſpoſition</hi> to credit or aſſent to evident truths, which comes in the laſt place to bee diſcuſſed, and <hi>their fooliſh heart was darkened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In darkning of the heart wee find <hi>three kindes of agents</hi> mentioned in holy writ, firſt <hi>God,</hi> of whom our <hi>Saviour</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:8070:40"/>out of <hi>Eſay tells vs, that the Iewes could not beleeue becauſe hee had blinded their eyes,</hi> which hee effects (ſayth <hi>Auſten) non impertiendo malitiam, not by imparting or infuſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but <hi>non impertiendo miſericordiam,</hi> by not impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mercy; or as vpon the 12. <hi>of Iohn.</hi> hee hath it, <hi>deſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo &amp; non adjuvando,</hi> by forſaking &amp; not helping or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting them with his illuminating grace. Secondly, the <hi>divell,</hi> whom God permitteth oftentimes to blinde thoſe, which hee will puniſh, as when hee ſuffereth a <hi>lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to go into the mouthes of the Prophets of Ahab, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them.</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22. Thirdly, <hi>our ſelues,</hi> who by our corrupt and inordinate affections, do caſt a vaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our owne eyes, that wee cannot ſee the truth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when it is moſt palpable: this the Apoſtle ſeemes in generall to intimate vnto vs in this whole chapter to haue bin a maine cauſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> blindnes for that ſeeking after wiſdome as it is 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and applauding themſelues with their humane inventions, they became leſſe prepar'd to yeeld atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue cares vnto the truth, ſo that the <hi>preaching of the croſſe was fooliſhneſſe</hi> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>ſcoffed at by their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> &amp; graced by no better a title then <hi>babling, Act.</hi> 17. in a word (ſaith <hi>Anſten</hi>) quod curioſitate invenerunt, per ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiam perdiderunt,</hi> pride loſt them that, which curioſity had gotten. But more particularly my text doth intimate it, when it diſcribes vnto vs what heart it is that is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to wit, <hi>cor inſipiens, ſtultu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ineptiens, <gap reason="foreign">

In a word if there be any prejudice, if there bee any foreſtalling, if any preoccupation in a minde, bent to vanities, that it becomes darkned, and cannot ſee the truth when it is moſt obvious &amp; plaine, the Apoſtle comprehends it in this one ſaying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, afooliſh heart. It is in man, as it was in the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the vineyard, let the Lord go to a farre country, I meane, let not his ſpirit be preſent with vs, and the ſoule
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8070:40"/>which ſhould roote out the wilde and ſowre grapes, that the whole Vine-yard of our bodies may yeelde pleaſant fruit vnto the Lord, will ſuffer the inferiour faculties to mutinie and reſiſt his meſſengers, though his Sonne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe come in Perſon vnto vs. This folly is not one <hi>ſingle individuum,</hi> nor one <hi>infima ſpecies,</hi> but like the Viper, which in euery letter of the Alphabet can ſhew ſome of her kinred; ſo in all ſocieties, all trades, all ſubjects, this fooliſhnes of heart can bragge, that ſhee puts out to nurſe ſome or other of her yong ones to do miſchiefe, &amp; darken the heart. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> therefore when he would expreſſe how God puniſhed the ſtiffe-necked <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, ſayth not, that he ſent falſe Prophets amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor that he ſuffered them to be deluded by lying wonders; but <hi>he gaue them vp to their owne hearts luſts,</hi> &amp; in this <hi>Chap.</hi> that <hi>he deliuered the Gentiles vnto their affectios,</hi> to ſignify what legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of deuils man carries in his heart, what Lyons, &amp; Beares, &amp; Wolues, &amp; vncouth beaſts within his breſt, what <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> in his braines, to tranſport him out of the way, though neuer ſo broad, if God's Spirit ſit not at the ſterne to direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

He ſpake alſo (ſaith the ſame verſe) of beaſts and fowles; in them he might haue ſeene how the <hi>Bees</hi> haue one King, the <hi>Cranes</hi> in their flight follow one Captaine, even <hi>heards</hi> in the field naturally incline to one Leader, all which might haue taught him, that all things are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and moderated not by many, but by one Governour. Beſides, he was more wiſe then either was the <hi>Chaldees</hi> or <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and therefore we can preſume him to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of none of their Arts and Diſciplines; and did not their <hi>Arithmeticke</hi> teach him, that numbers do proceede from vnities; their <hi>Geometrie,</hi> that magnitudes doc ariſe

Yet loe this <hi>Salomon,</hi> this bright morning ſtarre, ſets in the Weſt, &amp; is houſ'd in one of thoſe darke and ſmoakie degrees, mentioned by <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers;</hi> luſt and loue of his wiues poſſeſſe his fantaſie, and then whatſoeuer good object would preſent it ſelfe to his vnderſtanding, it is by the interpoſition of theſe earthly vanities, theſe fooliſhneſſes of heart darkened: It might be wiſely ſaid of him, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> once ſpake of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his dayes: <hi>O Lord, with the vnderſtanding which thou giueſt vnto men, they number the ſtarres of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſands of the ſea; they meaſure the heauens with their inſtruments, and foretell the Eclipſes of the Sunne and Moone many ages before-hand; they can ſay, that ſuch a yeare, &amp; ſuch a month, &amp; ſuch a day of the month, &amp; ſuch a houre of the day, there ſhall be an Eclipſe, and it falls out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and they are lifted vp, and greatly extolled which know theſe things;</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>per impiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiam recedentes ac deficientes à lumine tuo, tantò antè ſolis defectuns in futurum praevident, &amp; in praeſentia ſuum non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> through impious pride, their fooliſh hearts depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away from thy light, ſo long before they can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the darkening of the ſunne which is to come, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee their owne darkenes which is preſent.

Why doe wee not ſee our owne

Let vs looke at the laſt, into the Cloſet of our owne ſoules, and if wee finde the roome then darkened, that in ſeeing wee ſee not, and the Word is a ſealed booke vnto vs; then wee muſt know, that it is ſome fooliſhneſſe in the heart which is the cauſe of that blockiſh dulneſſe which is come vpon vs, anger hath troubled our affections, pleaſure hath ſtolne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our attention, profit hath corrupted our judgements; then muſt we returne vnto the Lord with prayer, that <hi>by glorifying God as God,</hi> and <hi>being thankefull,</hi> wee may haue our vaine imaginations removed, the fooliſhneſſe of our hearts expurged, and our darke vnderſtandings enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, one God, and three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, be rendered all praiſe, honour, and glory, might, majeſtie, and dominion, from this time forth for evermore.</p>

But had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we but the grace to conſider what true preparation is, the wonderfull fruites of it, and the manifold difficulties that alwayes croſſe it, moſt evidently it would appeare, that by this deceite more do periſh, then by all the guiles and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of Satan beſides: for that ſerpent which deceived our firſt parents even in paradiſe, better conſiders he then wee doe, how that he which is not fit to day, will be leſſe fit to morrow; that an enemy the leſſe expected, the hardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er repulſt; hee knowes the more our negligence is, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier is his entrance; the greater our improvidence, the more effectuall his violence, the leſſe we are ready to ſuffer for Chriſt, the leſſe Chriſt is ready to protect vs: whence our good inclinations are the weaker, our vnderſtanding the more darkned, our will the more perverted, our appetite the more diſſordered, all our inferiour parts and paſſions the more ſtrengthened, and ſtirred vp againſt the rule of reaſon, whereby his footing is the ſtronger, and our caſe the more deſperate. Laſtly he is privy to the croſſes and perills of our life, to the dangers that may befall vs, to the objects that may withdraw vs, to the calamities that may at any time deject vs, ſo that if once hee ſpie vs but to lye open, he doubteth not but to ſubdue vs vnder him. Now ſhall we ſee this net and be yet intangled? know the guile of this old wreathing ſerpent, and yet never indeavour to prevent it? Moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly there is no man hath ſo litle care of himſelfe but that he hath deſire to prevent theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and to prepare himſelfe more ſeriouſly to reſiſt the temptations of the world, and when hee heareth the commendations of the Saints of God, their reſolution in defending Chriſt's cauſe, &amp; manfulneſse in ſuſtaining ſuch afflictions as befell them, hee wiſheth in his heart that hee alſo were ſuch an one, and groaneth oftentimes in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he never hath indeavour'd ſo to bee. But alas my good Chriſtian brother! what letteth at this inſtant,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8070:46"/>that this courſe ſhould not bee taken, what inconvenience would follow it, if preſently this were practiſed which for ever ſhould do vs good?

Wee would eſteeme him an vnwiſe marriner which will venter to ſea in a calme, and not haue his ſhippe able to brooke a tempeſt; and him to be an vnconſiderate ſtates-man, which in peace thinkes it needleſſe to provide munition for time of warre: the pyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire may be our teacher herein, which (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth) <hi>prepareth her meate in ſummer, and gathereth her food in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt;</hi> Now ſhall theſe vnreaſonable creatures &amp; brute beaſts bee more provident then man, the lord and ruler of them? ſhall the children of this world be more wiſe in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, then the children of the ſpirit in theirs? wee are not to thinke that tempeſts, or winters, or warres are nigh at hand or approaching onely; but wee are to conceiue our ſelues to be alwaies in the field, ever in battaile, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in a ſtorme; our whole life, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> is a <hi>warrefare;</hi> &amp; it is nothing elſe, faith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but <hi>a continuall temptation.</hi> I confeſſe it is no ſmall taske ſufficiently to reſolue ones ſelfe herein: the Fathers meditations on this ſubject are not books but volumes. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thought it the beſt diſcourſe to be alwaies talking of hell, &amp; <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierome</hi> ſayth, this voice of Chriſts continually ſounded in his eares, and awoke him, <hi>Surgite mortui, venite ad judicium,</hi> Ariſe you dead &amp; come to judgment. I cannot tell what others may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue, but me-thinkes this meditation ſhould be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to rouſe the drouſeſt ſpirit amongſt vs, and to provoke him to a ſerious reſolution to ſuffer vnder Chriſts banner. Hath God made mee and created mee, and ſhall I for feare

O God thy mercyes towards man haue beene innumerable! the ſtarres of the firmament, and the ſands of the ſea are but as an handfull to what thou haſt heaped vpon him; <hi>Et quid retribuemus Domino?</hi> What ſhall wee giue vnto thee, o Lord, for all the benefits thou haſt done vnto vs? <hi>Thou deſireſt no ſacrifice, elſe would we giue it thee, thou delighteſt no in burnt offerings: mille tui Siculis errant in montibus agni, for all the beaſts of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt are thine, and ſo are the cattell vpon a thouſand hills:</hi> behold therefore thy ſervants &amp; the worke of thy hands, doe with vs even as it ſhall ſeeme beſt in thy ſight, loe wee are all thy creatures. You ſee (beloved) the vſe of this one word <hi>Ready,</hi> though we haue time enough to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the croſſes of this world, and ability to vſe that time, and deſire to vſe that ability, and grace to proſper that deſire; yet it were fooliſhnes to put off the practiſe thereof vntill ſuch time as the dayes of temptation ſhall come vpon vs, when Satan will bee at the ſtrongeſt and wee at the weakeſt: though there bee twelue houres in the day to walke in, and it bee neuer too late (as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) to bee good; yet wee ſhould hold it indiſcretion, not to ſhut the doore till the theefe bee entred; and folly, not to put the head-peece on, till the blow be given. My counſell therefore ſhall bee that which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> giues to the <hi>Epheſ. c. 6. Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devill, and withſtand in the evill day: ſtand therefore, having your loynes girt about with truth, and having on the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, and your feete ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace:</hi> aboue all, taking the ſhield of faith, whereby yee ſhall bee able to quench all the fierie darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of ſalvation,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8070:47"/>and the ſword of the ſpirit which is the word of God, that you may not onely vanquiſh the allurements of the world, but alſo the threatnings of Antichriſt, not only the temptations of the fleſh within, but alſo the aſſaults of the adverſary without, that bonds may not diſmay you, death not terrifie you, but that in all juſt occaſions you may bee ready and prepared for the name of Chriſt, <hi>not to be bound onely, but to die alſo:</hi> which is the ſecond part of my text and commeth next to bee handled, <hi>I am ready not to be bound onely, but alſo to die,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wee ſee in the Apoſtle <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> a notable example of obedience: hee ſhutteth his eyes to all things elſe, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly openeth them to Gods word: hee maketh a way to ſerue God through all lets, all fleſhly impoſſibilities, and being in this way, hee trampleth vnder him his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and beateth a path for Gods word out of his owne heart: finally, he regardeth not what men ſay, nor what his owne thoughts can ſay, but having received his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, reſolues for his journey, ſuffering Gods wiſedome to reaſon for him, and Gods omnipotent power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to worke for him. For <hi>Paul</hi> was now ſuch a man as might haue hoped for reſt in his fleſh, hee might haue ſaid, Lord I haue ſerv'd thee theſe many yeares in ſufficient trialls of my loue and obedience, in perills of waters, in perills of robbers, in ſtripes, in ſhipwracke, in hunger and thirſt, in cold and nakedneſſe, now I am old, giue mee now immunity, let mee be no longer preſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he had acceſſe to God and familiarity, he knew God was pittifull, and mercifull, and eaſie to be entreated, and yet he never ſpake one word for himſelfe, or his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement: Hee complained not of his greife, he deſired not to haue the burden leſned, but as if hee had the feete of an hinde, runnes many a tedious dayes journey by way of the commandement, till at length hee arrived at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. Freedome and liberty are more worth then gold,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8070:47"/>as the ſaying is, <hi>but skinne for skinne, and all that a man hath hee will giue for his life, Iob.</hi> 2. the <hi>Caſualiſts</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a matter of life and death, forbid to adminiſter an oath to any in his own cauſe: wherfore if any thing might plead exemption from Gods edicts, then might this caſe of bonds and death, and if any man, then queſtionleſſe might <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> more then any other in this caſe: the ſtate of the Churches, whereof ſome were not ſo ſufficiently confirmed, others, with wolues which crept in amongſt them, not a litle diſtracted, did ſeeme to require it, but he ſo reſolutely vndergoing that which God commanded him, and ſubmitting himſelfe to whatſoever God, in the defence of his owne name ſhould impoſe on him, may not vnfitly direct vs to this concluſion: <hi>That neither bonds, nor death, nor any reſpect whatſoever, can bee of ſuch force or power, at to priviledge the leaſt backewardneſſe, or ſtarting backe in defending of Gods cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that loveth father or mother more then me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is not worthy of mee; and hee that loveth ſonne or daughter more then mee, is not worthy of mee; feare not them therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule, Luk.</hi> 12.5. In regard whereof God hath ever emboldened ſome valiant ſouldiers or others, and propoſ'd them to the Church for the reſt to imitate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Prophets, one hath his forehead as an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, harder then a flint, not to be diſmayed at mens proud lookes, howſoever they bee hard hearted and rebellious, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.8. another is a fenſed braſen wall, not to bee prevail'd againſt, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 15.20. and hence grew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Gods ſervants, not to ſhrinke backe or yeeld a foote, when Gods honour lay at the ſtake, or his Churches preſervation was any way intereſted. So <hi>Hanani</hi> is bold with <hi>Aſa,</hi> though the priſon follow it, <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſhly,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. The <hi>three children</hi> with <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> threatning the fiery furnace, <hi>Wee are not carefull
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8070:48"/>to anſwere thee in this matter, Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Herod,</hi> though his head pay for it, <hi>It is not lawfull for thee to haue thy brothers wife, Matt.</hi> 14. and <hi>Peter</hi> with the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> breathing threatnings and ſlaughter, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>Wee ought to obey God rather then man.</hi> In this life the Church hath neede of more then a lions heart, for ſhee ſhall ever finde enemies to reſiſt, afflictions to wraſtle with, teares to wipe, beaſts to fight with, calamities to ſubdue. In <hi>Egypt,</hi> it had <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> to oppreſſe it, in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael Manaſſeh's,</hi> and <hi>Ahabs</hi> to vexe it; in captivitie, <hi>Hamans</hi> to deſtroy it; and at returne, <hi>Tatnai's</hi> and <hi>Sanballats</hi> to diſcourage it. To ſay the truth, it is ſo appointed from the foundation of the world, that righteouſneſſe here ſhould ſuffer in ſecular conflicts; for ſo juſt <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlaine in the beginning, and before any example (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) firſt of all dedicated to martyrdome: him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an Holocauſt, and whole Hecatombs of Prophets, of whom as the <hi>authour</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> tells vs; <hi>Some were tortur'd, others mock't and impriſon'd, ſome, ſtoned and ſawen aſunder, others ſlaine with the ſword, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred about in ſheep-skins and goate-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy, they wandred i. deſerts, and in mountaines, and in dennes, and caues of the earth.</hi> To mee therefore (ſaith a religious divine) the caues, and priſons, and wilderneſſes are moſt welcome; for there it was either that the Prophets taught, or the Apoſtles preach't, or the Evangeliſts teſtified the truth of Chriſt. But ſuch hath ever beene the loue of God in protecting of his Church, that whereas all other things by vexation and oppreſſion, doe wane and decay; his Church like the moone, when the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes ſeemes to bee in oppoſition againſt her, giues ever moſt light, and is at the fulleſt. It is vſuall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to compare the Church to the arke, becauſe as none were ſaved from the deluge but ſuch as were in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8070:48"/>the arke, ſo none are delivered from eternall death, but ſuch as are really exiſting in the Church. But the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude holds, as well in reſpect of the ſtormes and tempeſts which alwayes accompanie it; the more the floods of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction doe increaſe, the more it is elevated and lifted vp towards heaven. Hence were drawne thoſe excellent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories of ancient fathers; Gods people (ſaith <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi>) are a vine planted by our Saviour, if you prune or cut it, the branches will ſproute the better. The bloud of Chriſtians is like ſeede, (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) the more they are mowed and cut downe, the thicker they will grow. The Church (ſaith <hi>Leo</hi>) is Gods field, the cares of corne are his ſervants, the more graines fall to the ground, the more eares doe multiply and riſe vp. As plants ſeated by rivers of waters, ſo is the Church oppugned by her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) no garden ſo flouriſheth being moiſtned by the ſtreames of running waters, as the Church when it is watered with the bloud of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Howſoever therefore wee eſteeme of afflictions and perfections, and pray to be deliuered from them; yet did wee but throughly examine their ends and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vſes, wee would freely confeſſe with the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning, then to goe to the houſe of feaſting:</hi> And indeede the ends of theſe chaſtiſings, propoſed in the Scripture, are manifold; the exerciſing and trying of the faithfull, the waking of the drowzie, the testifying of the truth, &amp;c. whereby the weake are confirmed, the ſluggiſh rowſ'd, and Gods power in mans weakenes the more manifeſted. To theſe <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auguſtine in his 78 Serm. de Tempore,</hi> prettily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes the ſtory of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> both ſtruggling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Rebeccah's</hi> wombe: for when <hi>Rebeccah</hi> went to enquire of the Lord concerning their ſtrugglings, the Lord ſaid vnto her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Two nations are in thy wombe, and two manner of people ſhall bee ſeparated from thy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8070:49"/>bowells, and the one people ſhall bee ſtronger then the other, and the elder ſhall ſerue the younger.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auſtin</hi> askes how this was fulfill'd, for wee never read at any time that the elder did ſerue or performe obedience to the younger. Hee anſwers therefore, the elder ſhall ſerue the younger, as wicked men doc ſerue the godly, <hi>non obſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, ſed perſequendo,</hi> not by obeying, but by perſecuting, as the hammer ſerues the mettall, as the mill ſerues the wheate, and as the furnace the gold when it tries it. It is a memorable ſaying therefore of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when hee was to be caſt to Lions to be devoured of them, I am the wheate and graine of Chriſt, I ſhall be ground with the teeth of wilde beaſts, that I may bee found pure bread. You ſee (beloved) how perſecutions and fiery trialls doe alwayes attend the Church whil'ſt it wanders in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſinne, ſo that ſo farre I am from aſſenting any thing to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who makes his 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> note of the true Church to bee <hi>foelicitas temporalis,</hi> temporall felicity; that rather with our owne divines I take <hi>cruces,</hi> the croſſes of this world, though they are not a note, to bee a condition of the Church militant. Seeing therefore that ſufferings arc neceſſary, it is a Chriſtian vertue by a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous patience to make them voluntary: we muſt not revolt with <hi>Demas,</hi> nor follow afarre off with timorous <hi>Peter,</hi> nor diſſemble our profeſſion by Ieſuiticall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, but reſt ſtedfaſt in the faith, knowing that if wee ſuffer with Chriſt, wee ſhall alſo raigne with him, if wee forſake houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for his names ſake; wee ſhall be recompenſed in this life with peace of conſcience, and in the other with felicity.</p>
            <p>But (boloved) the loved of the voyce of more then a trumpet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in theſe daſtardly times of ours, wherein men are as farre from the zeale of thoſe godly Saints, as they are degenerated from their vertuous manners. Every one in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8070:49"/>the defence of his owne cauſe will bee eager enough, we want no courage to ſtoute and braue it in defence of our wicked liues and lewd manners, a man is not afraid to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge his brother into the field, &amp; ſeeke to ſhed his bloud with hazard of his owne life, though he fight againſt God and the juſt lawes arm'd with vengeance; but in Chriſts cauſe, hee will be more faint-hearted then <hi>Peter,</hi> who denied his maſter at the voyce of a ſilly chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide; or at leſt-wiſe rather then hee will looſe a friend, will not ſticke to diſpeaſe God. But alas! ſelfe will'd and inconſiderate man, little doeſt thou marke the ſtepps thou treadeſt, or the downe-fall of that way wherein thou po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt; ſhall Chriſt be thought to be thy maſter, when thou art aſham'd openly to be his ſervant? ſhall he receiue thee which rejecteſt him? or ſuppoſe, thou wilt greatly eſteem his robes of glory, which voluntarily doeſt here put on the devils livery? No, no (beloved) he hath taught vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: <hi>Hee that confeſſeth not me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before men, him will I deny before my Father which is in heaven: Hee that loveth father or mother, or ſonne or daughter more then mee, is not worthy of mee.</hi> Wee are vnworthy indeede to be his ſouldiers, if wee will not take vp our croſſe &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Alas! what thing of moment can there be which may yeeld a coloured pretence to ſhake off our allegeance to ſo good a maſter? <hi>Shall persecution, or anguiſh, or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, or famine, or nakednes, or perill, or ſword? why, in all theſe wee are more then conquerours through him that loved vs.</hi> Sufferings and bonds are not things execrable to Chriſtians; for a Chriſtian mans breaſt, whoſe hope conſiſts wholly in the tree, dreadeth neither bat nor club; woundes and ſcarres of the body bee ornaments to him, ſuch as bring no ſhame nor diſhoneſty to the party, but rather preferre and free him with the Lord. Though in dungeons there bee no beds for his body to reſt on, yet hath hee reſt in Chriſt, and though his weary bones
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8070:50"/>lye vpon the cold ground, you hee thinkes it no paine for him to lye with his Saviour. Ones feete may be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with bonds and chaines, but happily is hee bound of men, whom the Lord Chriſt doth looſe; happily doth he lye tyed in the ſtockes, whoſe feete are thereby ſwifter to runne to heaven. Neither can any man rye a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſo faſt, but that hee runneth ſo much the faſter for his garland of life; ſay one hath no garment to ſaue him from cold, yet he that putteth on Chriſt is ſufficiently coated; ſay bread doe lacke to your hungry bodyes, but man liveth not by bread onely, but by every word proceeding from the mouth of God. What if we ſhorten our dayes of miſery, doe we not the ſooner make our entrance into better of glory? What if wee ſuffer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of body? but oh let vs more ſeare, leaſt wee for ever looſe the joyes of the ſoule! But ſome (perhaps) will thinke it impertinent to vrge this hard and vnſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precept at ſuch a calme of the Church, wherein every man eates of his owne vineyard, who gathers quietly the fruite himſelfe, which hee himſelfe hath planted, there are now no perſecutions (men will ſay) no bonds nor death threatned for Chriſts name, (and God graunt theſe words may never more be heard in this our Iſrael, God grant it I ſay,) but in the meane time, ſhall we be ſo ſenceleſſe as to thinke that Chriſts name is now baniſhed this Iland, and that it ſurceaſ'd with the bloud of Martyrs? No, it is converſant amongſt vs, and ſummons her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions as reſolutely to defend it as ever it did: but where is it? why, 'tis every where; that poore man oppreſſed, is Chriſts cauſe; that ſicke brother, that wretch, that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that naked body, that widow, that orphane childe; heare what our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. <hi>What you haue done vnto one of the leaſt of theſe my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you haue done it vnto mee.</hi> And doe you aske yet where is Chriſts cauſe? why, 'tis in the midſt of you;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8070:50"/>are any of your neighbours drunkards or prophane? there it is; are any of your ſervants diſorderly or negligent? there it is; are any of your children diſobedient or diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute? why, there it is. Say not as the wicked do, it is in the wilderneſſe, it is in the deſert, it is in Spaine, it is in Rome; no, but examine your owne hearts, &amp; if you find there written the God of the world, then be bold to ſay, lo here is Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s cauſe, here I muſt fight valiantly to deſtroy the kingdome of Satan and to vanquiſh Chriſt's enemy. No ſacke of a citty is ſo lamentable as when the divell entreth into a ſoule, and when hee cryes downe with an heart and ſinkes the whole man into ruine and perdition. Come on therefore decre Chriſtians, you which ſtand for Chriſt's name haue a ſtrong cauſe, why haue you faint hearts? I confeſſe that there be <hi>Cananites</hi> which muſt bee expulſed before we can obtaine the land of promiſſe, and <hi>Schons</hi> and <hi>Oggs,</hi> gyants of monſtrous ſtature to appale &amp; affright vs, but doth not the matter ſtand juſt ſo with the affaires of this world? Can one obtain any thing here amongſt men but he muſt get it by violence? ſeeke we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame violence the things in heaven, with which wicked men do ſeeke the things of this world. Here wee can get nothing without labour, watching, trouble, venture, fight; do but the ſame, and ſee heaven is offered! how much difference in the ends, and ſee the meanes are both one. And ſo I paſſe <hi>à gravitate rei,</hi> from the greatneſſe of the thing which the Apoſtle was ready to vndergo, <hi>ad Qualitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſae,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cauſe, which comes in the laſt place to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, <hi>For the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee read in hiſtories how prodigall ſome haue beene of their liues; honour, eaſe, devotion, ſhame, want, paine, any thing ſerved them for a reaſon not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forſake themſelues, or to expoſe themſelues to vnevitable dangers, but alſo to bee their owne exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners. <hi>Gellius in his fifteenth booke and twentieth ch.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:8070:51"/>tell's of the women of a certain towne, that in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had brought it vp for a faſhion to kill themſelues. Next to them ſeem'd to be thoſe in the Primitiue Church, which invented new wayes of martyrdome, with hunger; wherewith they were ſo tranſported, that ſome of them taught, that vpon conſcience of ſin, to kill ones ſelfe, was by this act of juſtice a martyrdome: vpon which ground <hi>Petillian,</hi> againſt whom <hi>S Auſtine</hi> writes, canonized <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> for a Martyr. The rage and fury of the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> in extorting this imagined martyrdome, brought them firſt to ſollicite and importune others to kill them, and if they failed in that ſuite, they did it themſelues; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſect proſpered ſo farre in heaping vp nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, that their whole ſect, as <hi>Epiphamius</hi> tell's vs, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Martyriani.</hi> Diverſe therefore contributing their Helps to the preſervation and tranquillity of ſtates, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their beſt inventions to remedy theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to divert men from ſuch precipitate courſes. <hi>Ariſtotle in the</hi> 3. <hi>of his Ethickes and</hi> 7. <hi>chap.</hi> to correct the opinion of getting honour by that act, taught that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more baſe and cowardly then to kill ones ſelfe, became (ſayth hee) men did it not, either for heneſties ſake, or for the good of the common-weale, but onely to bee freed from ſome inconveniences, which they thought might moleſt them. The Spaniards in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had another policie; when they found a generall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and practiſe in the inhabitants to kill themſelues to avoid ſlavery, they had no way to reduce them, but by ſome diſſembling and outward counterfeiting, to make them beleeue that they alſo killed themſelues, and ſo went with them into the next world, and afflicted them more there then they did in this. Princes likewiſe haue inflicted forfietures and infamous mulcts vpon them which ſhould ſo ſlay themſelues; and the Church by her Canons hath denyed them buriall. Thus in ſundry times
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8070:51"/>placet, ſundry meanes haue beene thought of to prevent and diſſwade men from ſuch inconſiderate actions. But Almighty God, who diſpoſeth all things ſweetely, hath beene ſo indulgent to our nature and the frailty thereof, that hee hath afforded vs a meanes how to giue away our life, and yet ſo as it ſhall bee pleaſing to him; which is, by delivering our ſelues to martyrdome, ſo that it bee for the teſtimony of his name, and the advancing of his glory, For in this wee reſtore him his talent with profit, our owne ſoule, with as many more as our example workes vpon and winnes to him. This is that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in the words of my text, declaring that <hi>hee was ready not to bee bound onely, but alſo to dye at Hieruſalem.</hi> But becauſe <hi>martyrem non facit poena ſed cauſa,</hi> as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> tell's vs, it is not the puniſhment but the cauſe which makes a martyr; the Apoſtle would not ſo leaue vs in a doubt , as if to dye ſimply were good or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and as if it were lawfull in any occaſion to be profuſe and prodigall of ones bloud; but intimates the quality of the cauſe, which makes true martyrdome, not to be fame, or honour, or any worldly reſpect, but onely the name of the Lord Ieſus: from which example of our bleſſed Apoſtle may it pleaſe you to inferre with mee this concluſion; <hi>That, that cauſe which warrants true martyrdome, is to bee the maintaining of Chriſt's truth and the defending of his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wicked and the godly, may both haue the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but not the ſame cauſe; Chriſt was crucified and the theeues were crucified, but <hi>quos paſſio jungebat, cauſa ſeparabat (ſaith Auſtine)</hi> whom the paſſion did joyne, the cauſe did ſever; which he ſweetly thus preſſeth from thoſe words of the kingly Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. <hi>Arife and wake to my judgement, even to my cauſe, my God and my Lord:</hi> not to puniſhment (ſaith the Father)but to my cauſe, not to that which the theife hath common with mee, but to that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8070:52"/>which the bleſſed onely can challenge, <hi>who ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for righteouſneſſ ſake: Mat.</hi> 5. Now that wee may the better know what is to bee vnderſtood by the name of Chriſtian in this place, and in what reſpects it may truely be tearmed martyrdome, which one ſuſtaines in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it; wee muſt note that all true martyrdome for Chriſts ſake is grounded vpon one of theſe three preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and claimes: The <hi>firſt</hi> is the ſealing with our bloud the profeſsion of ſome morall truth, which though it be not directly of the body of the Chriſtian faith, nor expreſt in the articles thereof; yet it is ſome of thoſe workes which a Chriſtian man is bound to do: Such was the martyrdome of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> when hee was beheaded for telling <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> that it was not lawfull for him to haue his brothers wife: <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, the maintaining with loſſe of life the integrity of the Chriſtian faith, and not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part thereof to periſh and corrupt: Such were the martyrdomes of the Prophets before Chriſt, of the Fathers in the Ten firſt perſecutions, and of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants here in <hi>England</hi> in Queene <hi>Marie's</hi> dayes. The <hi>third</hi> is, the endeavouring by the ſame meanes to preſerue the liberties and immunities of the Church: which are two fold, either natiue and connaturall to the Church, as preaching the word, adminiſtring the Sacraments, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying medicinall cenſure; or acceſſory, ſuch as for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance &amp; advancement of the worſhip of God, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes haue given vnto it. If any to whoſe charge God hath committed theſe by an ordinary calling do looſe his life either in the execution of the former, or for a pious &amp; dutifull admonition to the Prince for the latter, wee may juſtly eſteeme him for a martyr.</p>
            <p>But to come to our application; Chriſt hath his martyrs, and Antichriſt would haue his alſo. It may make ſome peradventure to wonder and ſtand aſtoniſht, at the ſtrange hardneſſe of ſome prieſts &amp; Ieſuites of the Roman religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8070:52"/>their reſolution to dye for their <hi>Bell</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but ſhould wee but ſift the truth of the point, wee ſhould finde that it is not Chriſt's cauſe that they dye for; nor his Name which with the Apoſtle here they ſo ſtand for, but that other reaſons and by-reſpects do induce them to this falſe martyrdome. To ſee one laviſh of his bloud, would perſwade a ſimple man to thinke that the cauſe could not be but good: but alas! it is not true zeale, but fury which driues them to theſe exigences, it is not the loue of their Maſter Chriſt, but the hope of avoyding Purgatory, and of meriting heaven, which ſo advanceth this corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet this I will ſay, that if the ſuſtaining of death for the defence of one's cauſe could end the controverſie, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> the greateſt Doctor of the Romiſh Church, would giue the Vmpire to our ſide, for in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>book de ſignis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia &amp;</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> he ingeniousſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth, that Martyrdome can be no note of the Romiſh Church, becauſe (ſaith he) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſects there are, amongſt which he name's the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> who haue ever bin moſt forward in dying for their Religion. But let vs goe on, and examine a little, whether thoſe Ieſuites and Prieſts, according to the ground laide downe before, can challenge the names of true Martyrs, or no. To beginne therefore with the firſt kinde of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is, for defending ſome morall truth; doe they dye for defending any ſuch verity? No (beloved) it is for oppugniug euen the rirſt Commandement, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our duty towards man; that Commandement teacheth vs, that we ſhould honour our Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by which is meant not only our naturall Parents, but likewiſe all higher powers, and eſpecially ſuch as haue ſoveraigne authority over vs as Kings and Princes, whom the Scripture doth terme <hi>nurſing Fathers of the Church, Eſay</hi> 49. But they are executed for plotting their deaths, for contriving powder-treaſons, for affirming that the Pope may depoſe the King, that hee may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him, and then giue his Subjects a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8070:53"/>priviledge to aſſaſſinate him, ſo that for defending any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall truth they are not Martyrs, but rather for breaking of ſo great a Commandement, they dye as guilty offenders both of God and the Lawes of the Land. Well then, let's goe to the Articles of Faith, may they beterm'd Martyrs, becauſe they ſtand for the vp-holding of any part of the Creed? therein do they maintaine the Name of <hi>Ieſus?</hi> No (beloved) though ſome of them are called <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> yet are they ſo farre from being ſo indeed, that as <hi>Whitaker</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned divine of ours hath obſerv'd, there is no point of their doctrine wherein they differ from vs, but either therein they deny the Name of Ieſus, or the Name of Chriſt, one of our Saviour's two Names is alwayes infring'd by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But yet they will ſay (perhaps) that they dye for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Churche's immunities &amp; priviledges; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do deſcrue to be called Martyrs: (They may wel indeed ſay, their Churche's, for I cannot ſay, Chriſt's Church.) But what are the Priviledges which they pretend? why, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Prieſts will tell you, they are thoſe which our Saviour gaue to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> in <hi>Matt.,</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. in theſe words, <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will build my Church.</hi> But what meane theſe words? are they any thing elſe then that Chriſt would build his Church vpon that rocke, that is, vpon that confeſſion of <hi>Peter's</hi> immediatly before vttered, <hi>That he was the Sonne of God?</hi> this indeede is the true ſenſe; but yet the Pope's Canon-Law hath pleaſ'd to giue another interpretation, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Romane ſpeech, (I am ſure neither in the Greeke nor Latine) thou art Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and vpon thee as thou art ſuch an one, I will build my Church; but not onely vpon thee <hi>Peter,</hi> for there ſhall be no moreBi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> of that name; but vpon thee <hi>Gregory,</hi> vpon thee <hi>Adrian, Iulius, Ioane,</hi> vpon euery Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> good or bad, holy or prophane, Chriſtian or Atheiſt, be he what he will, I will build my Church; and vnder this I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8070:53"/>thee Monarch, both of things temporall, and things ſpirituall, Soveraigne King and Biſhop together; of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, to controlle the Olde Teſtament, to diſpenſe againſt the Goſpell, and againſt the Apoſtles, to make new articles of faith, to be aboue all Councels, and when thou trayleſt men by thouſands into hell, I would haue no man to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion thee, why doeſt thou this? Of Temporall, to diſpoſe of all the World, to diſtribute it at thy pleaſure, as if it were thine own heritage, to raigne over Kings, to arraigne and indite them, to depoſe them, to abſolue their ſubjects from their Oath of Allegiance, to expoſe their eſtates for a prey, their perſons to murther, to beſtow their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes on whom it ſhall pleaſe thee, and laſtly to change their tenures to fealty, or convert their territories to their owne demaine. Pitty will ſtrike one here into hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: but ſweete <hi>Ieſus,</hi> were theſe the priviledges which thou bequeathed'ſt to <hi>S. Peter?</hi> were theſe the dignities which thou conferred'ſt on thy Church? thy profeſſion was wont to be that thy Kingdome was not of this world, that the ſervant is not greater then his Maſter; and thy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles haue taught vs, <hi>that euery ſoule ſhould be ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to higher powers;</hi> &amp; may now any be ſo hardy, as to claime this Imperiall ſway from thy donation? Alas beloued, this challenge by the Pope, is farre from the promiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and of <hi>S. Peter</hi> himſelfe! let's looke into his 1 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,</hi> and 2 <hi>Chap.</hi> where he enjoynes <hi>all men to feare God, and honour the King,</hi> and wee ſhall perceiue that his ſcope was obedience, ſubjectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, duty. Poore man whil'ſt he liv'd he was in want and need, ſilver and gold he had none; and ſee, ſince his death the Pope hath provided for him a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kingdome. All the Churche's priviledges which they dye for (if they dye for any) are theſe which you haue heard; whether he deſerves the name of a Martyr, which dyes for ſuch manifeſt impieties, judge you. Of all their Martyrs it may be ſaid, as once <hi>S. Auſtine in his</hi> 68. <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:8070:54"/>ſaid of the <hi>Donatiſts, Vivebant vt latrones, honorab antur vt martyres;</hi> they liue murtherers, and traitours, &amp; falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp; a painted ſtraw ſhall make them to bee honour'd as Martyrs. Our caſe (thankes be to God) is farre differing from theirs; we know whoſe name it is which we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: &amp; if ever the Lord marched before vs in a pillar of fire to ſhew vs the true way we are to take, he doth it this day; here you ſee the repreſentation of his death, theſe are thoſe remembrances he left vs, to ſhew how he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our cauſe, &amp; theſe are they which put vs in minde what we are to do againe in his cauſe. His Supper hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to begirt &amp; arme vs to withſtand his enemies. He which is loath to put on this armour, is vnwilling to fight his battaile. Let no man therefore drawback when Chriſt offereth to aſſiſt him with ſuch munition. Let no man ſay, I am vnworthie, but put his confidence in his Saviour, which makes him worthie. Wee may not deceiue our ſelues (beloved) he is not vnworthy to eate his body and drinke his bloud, which thinkes himſelfe vnworthy: for vnto ſuch Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come vnto me all ye which are laden,</hi> &amp; I <hi>will eaſe you;</hi> but he is vnworthy which is loath to bee made worthier, which is prophane in his life, and meanes yet to be ſo, which is malicious in his thoughts, &amp; reſolv's to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſo, which is covetous in his heart, &amp; purpoſeth to abide ſo; to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if any be here ſo minded, I giue this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, touch not, taſte not, handle not thoſe ſacred reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blances of your Redeemer: this Supper indeed is an armour of proofe, to ſhield all ſuch as do fight truly in Chriſt's cauſe; but if you warre vnder the divel's banner, it will prove like <hi>Saul's armour</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> it will preſſe you downewards: it is a weapon left vs to put Satan to flight; but if you fight not on God's ſide, it will bend it ſelfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ſelues, &amp; like the <hi>Midianites</hi> ſwords, will ſticke in your owne ſides. But I hope better things of you. In Baptiſme you receiv'd your preſſe-money,&amp; were
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8070:54"/>entred into your Captaine <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> his Booke; then you made your firſt vow, to fight againſt the world, the fleſh, &amp; the divell: you muſt remember if that you will be expert and able ſouldiers, you are often to be muttered &amp; train'd, often muſt you beare the colours, often take the bread of munition during this ſpirituall warrefare. You ſee as there is a prize to winne, ſo there is a buckler to defend you, food to ſtrengthen you. Courage, courage therefore for Heauen, for CHRIST, for the Crowne of Glory: it is a ſhame in ſuch a multitude of thoſe that profeſſe CHRIST, that there are ſo few which truly follow him, &amp; that men are like <hi>Pharaoh's leane kine,</hi> in the rich and plentifull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrures of the Goſpell; the bloud of Martyrs was the milke which nurſt the Primitiue Church in her infancie, &amp; ſhall it be too hard for our diſgeſtion now? it was the ſeede of the Church out of which we ſprung, and ſhall wee grudge to tithe our ſelues to God in any proportion that he will accept? But the Apoſtles are dead, and thoſe great lights of example the Patriarchs, the Prophets, &amp; the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and wee haue their ſepulchres with vs; yet let their hope, their zeale, their faith, their conſtancy, their patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce liue. I ſpeake with more vehemency, becauſe I know not what concernes vs more then this Scripture, <hi>Hee that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his life for my ſake ſhall finde it.</hi> Loe we ſtand vpon our being, or not being; vpon having, or looſing of our ſoules: the God of loue and peace giue vs all the ſpirit of zeale, hope, and patience, that in the ſweate of Ieſus Chriſt wee may overcome all faintings of the heart, all reluctations of the fleſh, all bitterneſſe of temptation: To him therefore, with the Father, and Holy Ghoſt, one God and three Perſons, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all praiſe, honour, and glory, now and for evermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the occaſion might bee which moued our Saviour to make this reply, Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on all parts doe not agree. <hi>Tertullian, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Chriſt here tax'd his Mother and Brethren, as if the ſcope of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had bin, to ſhew their kinred with our Saviour, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8070:56"/>their authority over him. Others thinke hee reprehended onely their vnſeaſonable and inconſiderate proclaiming of their affinity with him, becauſe by this meanes (ſay ſome) the divell might take an opportunity to extinguiſh that opinion which ſome (a little before) began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of his divinity. But <hi>Hierome</hi> thinks rather, he blamed by this anſwer, him which interrupted him in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as who ſhould tempt him, whether he would preferre fleſh &amp; bloud before the ſpirituall worke of his Vocation. Of all theſe the Popiſh Writers can beſt brooke them which caſt any aſperſion of a fault vpon our Lady; whom the <hi>Councell of Trent in the</hi> 6. <hi>Seſſ:</hi> would redeeme if not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being conceived in originall ſin, yet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any actual tranſgreſſion. <hi>Tolet</hi> therfore the Ieſuite, would haue theſe words in my Text to imply no reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but rather an admonition or commonefaction; albeit <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> ſo he may ſaue our Lady from a chiding, ſtands not greatly whether it were beſtowed vpon Chriſt's bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or vpon him which told our Saviour of his mothers being without. For mine owne part, though I am not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to impute any obliquitie to the bleſſed Virgin at this time; yet farre bee it from mee to ſay, that there was ever any (Chriſt onely excepted) which liv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne. For what is that of our Saviours to <hi>Mary, Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>Woman, what haue</hi> I <hi>to doe with thee,</hi> but a reprehendſion? and ſhall Chriſt reprehend where there was no fault? What other thing can thoſe wordes of <hi>Maryes</hi> import, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath reioyced in God my Saviour?</hi> but that ſhee confeſſed her ſinnes, when ſhee acknowledged a Saviour. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore in <hi>his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> booke de amiſſione gratiae, and</hi> 16. <hi>Chapter,</hi> denyes not that ſhee had a Saviour, and that remiſſion of ſinnes was neceſſary vnto her, as well as vnto others; but he would faine recover himſelfe with this ſhift, ſaying, that thoſe ſinnes were remitted vnto her,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8070:56"/>
               <hi>non in quae inciderat, ſed in quae incidiſſet, niſi gratia Dei per merit a Chriſti praeventae ſuiſſet:</hi> not thoſe into which ſhee fell, but thoſe into which ſhee would haue fallen, bad not the grace of God prevented her; as if forſhooth God vſed to impute thoſe ſins to men which they never committed, or as if a King ſhould be ſtow his pardon of felony vpon him which never ſtole, and yet thinke it a great favour. As for the words of my text, I deny not but that the of died Virgin might come with good intent vnto our Saviour, hoping either to heare him &amp; ſee him, as ſome would haue it:or as others, to recouer him from thoſe traps &amp; ſhares which the Scribes &amp; Phariſces laid to entrap him withall. Yet I may well gather thus much, that if our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not in this place an errour already commited, yet he giueth a caveat of one which might be committed; and if I may not ſay he blameth one paſt, it is plaine he preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts one to come. For what do not men conceiue of the bond of kinred? might not the Iewes ſuppoſe that our Saviour would haue granted great privileges to thoſe which clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med affinity or conſanguinity with him? or at leſt haue omitted his preaching and teaching at their importunity? Hee therefore either to divert them from ſuch fancies, or to ſhew by his owne example how highly we are to value the exerciſe of our heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly calling before al reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to our earthly parents, anſwered as wee read it ſet down in <hi>Mathew, &amp; Markes goſpell, Who is my mother, &amp; who are my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid: it is ſo indeed with the world that kinred &amp; conſanguinity are of great importance, that they beare great ſway in mens affections, and potent orators they are to turne them which way they liſt. This wholy I diſlike not, nay rather as I my ſelfe was ever obedient vnto my parents, ſo leaue I this commandement vnto you, that of all others you moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your eares to them and hearken vnto their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: but now I am about the buſineſſe of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8070:57"/>ſexes. Whoſoever heares the word of God and doth it (ſaith hee;) hee excludes not men, nor alters the caſe with women, they are all of them both his mother and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Morally indeed (as <hi>Ianſenius</hi> expounds it) hee may be tearmed his brother, becauſe hee is the ſon of the ſame heavenly father &amp; joynt heire with Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. and his mother becauſe Chriſt is borne a new in him by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nativity, according to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My little children with whom I travell in birth againe vntill Chriſt be formed in you.</hi> But becauſe it is true which <hi>S.

            <p>How nearely the elect and choſen veſſels of God are linked to Chriſt, may ſundry wayes be ſhewed out of the writings of the holy Ghoſt. For firſt, they haue a neere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation vnto him <hi>in reſpect of nature,</hi> whereby hee is their father by the right of Creation; for though from their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts they take their bodies derivation, as being Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in their production, yet vpon him they depend as vpon the principall efficient: <hi>in him we liue, and moone, and have our being</hi> (ſayth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Act.</hi> 17. and in this reſpect <hi>Adam</hi> is is termed the Sonne of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.38. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are neerely adjoyned vnto him, <hi>in reſpect of grace;</hi> &amp; indeed this ſeemes a more neere conjunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any can be of kinred or affinity, for in this regard <hi>Chriſt is termed the head, they the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, Eph.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Chriſt the husband, they the ſpouſe,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Chriſt the vine, they the branches, Ioh.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Chriſt the fountaine, they the brooke, Ioh.</hi> 4.14. and if any thing may more plainely expreſſe the neereneſſe and conjunction they haue with him; hee calls himſelfe <hi>via &amp; vita,</hi> the way and the life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a woman therefore had ſaid vnto him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be that bare thee, &amp; the paps that gaue thee ſuck; yea rather</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>bleſſed are they that heare the word of God &amp; keepe it.</hi> yea. rather; <hi>non carnales pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes negat, ſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituales Praefert;</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maldonat</hi>) he denies not his naturall pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but prefer's, his ſpirituall. <hi>Matre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matri, fraters fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus anteponit,</hi> he preferres his mother hearing the word, before his mother giuing him ſucke: his brethren doing the will of God, before his brethren deſcending from the ſame parents. What if <hi>Mary</hi> were his mother by bearing him in her wombe? yet her motherhood ſeemed redoubled in her when ſhee conceiued him in her ſoule. If <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Ioſes</hi> might call him brother, becauſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8070:58"/>they were linked vnto him by the bond of the fleſh, yet more truely were they then his brethren, when they were ſo made by the bond of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But I neede not inſiſt longer vpon the proofe of a point ſo evident. I will now come to apply it to our ſelues; we ſee the neere alliance wee haue with Chriſt, and through Chriſt, one with another: the great King of heaven and earth vouchſafeth to incorporate vs into his family, and as if it were too little to place vs in any remote degrees of alliance, he graceth vs with thoſe excellent, and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate names, of Mother and Brethren. O let vs not ſwell and be carried away with the meere titles thereof, but endeavour to make manifeſt to the world, that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are correſpondent to our appellations. Men and brethren, are you ambitious of this high dignity, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his brother? Would you bee ſtyled with ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent a title? Why, you muſt performe then the offices of a brother to him, by reducing your ſelues, and by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others to his faith; you muſt raiſe vp ſeed vnto him, and become the ſonnes of the ſame heavenly father. Are any amongſt you, which affect the priviledges of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Thinke yee not that alſo to bee a thing impoſſible that our bleſſed Saviour ſhould be borne againe, and that of any other beſides his virgin mother? though to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man this ſeeme impoſſible, yet to the ſpirituall man it will ſeeme eaſie, and of no difficulty to be performed. Beleeue but his word, and you haue conceived him in your wombe; doe but his will, and you haue brought him forth into the world; entertaine but his meſſengers, and you embrace him in your armes; releiue but him which craues a cup of cold water in his name, &amp; you giue him ſucke. This is a grace not appropriated to women onely, nor onely to the married, for men alſo and virgins themſelue, may bee the happy mothers of ſuch an iſſue. But alas (beloved) how is it that we ſo ſleight &amp; ſo little
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8070:59"/>value this vnſpeakeable honour? wee recount our carnall pedegrees, and are puft vp if an herauld can deriue our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from any noted family vpon earth, which yet began but yeſterday, and perhaps will periſh before night; and doe wee thinke it a ſmall thing that wee are here offered to bee admitted into ſo noble an alliance, as to haue God to our Father, and Chriſt to our Sonne and brother? The greateſt Monarch vpon earth can ſhew his deſcent, but for ſome hundred of yeares, although few can preſcribe for ſo long; ſo ſubject to changes and alterations are all things vnder the funne; and ſhall it not bee our ambition to reject thoſe vaine and vpſtart deſcents, when wee haue ſuch evidences as theſe to deriue our pedegree from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? In our naturall deſcents there is great vncertainty, heraulds may bee corrupted, wrirings loſt, deedes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but in our ſpirituall alliance with Chriſt, our names are written in the booke of life which no forgery can counterfeit, nor injury of time deface. But the world vnderſtands not this, and the fooliſh will not beleeue it, a greater matter they thinke it, to be of a noble houſe, and to haue had ſuch and ſuch anceſtors: why, (beloved) let vs reaſon together; what content can a man finde to deriue himſelfe from him whom hereafter hee will Judge moſt vile and wretched? what a fondneſſe were it to build ones reputation vpon the glory of ſuch an one, as perhaps the next day hee ſhall follow to the place of execution with execrations and curſes? And yet this may be the caſe betweene vs and our glorious progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, whom now wee ſo vaunt of; who knowes whether at Chriſts appearance hee ſhall not rife vp in judgement againſt them and condemne them? Who can aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether thoſe which the world accounted as worthies, ſhall not bee found at the laſt day, to haue beene but painted clouts, and full of ſlime and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within? And yet the greateſt ſort of men are proud,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8070:59"/>and ſelfe conceited, that they are deſcended even from thoſe, who were ſo cruell vnto them, that the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they gaue them life, they gaue them alſo the ſting of death, in their fleſh; and in the meane time, they ſet at naught the alliance they haue with the Lord of life, or that they may bee in ſo honourable a ranke, as to bee Chriſts mother or his brethren. And what is the iſſue of all? Why, wee reject God from being our Father, that wee may glory only in earthly anceſtours; we exclude Chriſt from being our eldeſt brother, that wee may apply our ſelues to the brethren of our owne houſe; wee renounce for our kinſmen the bleſſed troupes of Saints and Angels, that wee may haue none of our ſtocke but whom the world applauds and counts happie. This was not the practiſe of the godly in the Scripture, wee reade of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how when hee came to years, he refuſed to bee called the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon: Heb.</hi> 11.24. for, to ſay the truth, our earthly affinity is but tranſitory, and abideth not, if you would purchaſe an everlaſting and never-dying kindred, call them your brethren which are humbled with adverſity, for theſe ſhall bee partners with you in the kingdome of God; call them your brethren, which haue forſaken the ſplendour of the world, for theſe ſhall raigne with you for ever in heaven; call them your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which haue renounced the ambitious titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for theſe ſhall inherit with you the crowne of righteousſneſſe; call them your brethren, vvhich heare the vvord of God and doe it, for theſe muſt bee your companions in glory. Linke not your ſelues with the covetous for wealth, with the proud for honour, with the voluptuous for pleaſure, with the hollow-hearted in religion for gaine and preferment; but if you vvould knit an vnſeparable knot of kindred, let your brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8070:60"/>bee founded in Chriſt, leſt at your deaths you bee both of you either everlaſtingly ſeparated, or everlaſtingly confounded. I confeſſe it is an hard thing to perſwade fleſh and bloud to follow this, they will ſcarce beleeue that Chriſt by the right of kinred, claimes ſuch an intereſt in them, as that by his example they ſhould ſo much preferred the ſpirituall alliance they haue vvith him, before that vvhich they haue vvith their owne kinred. For doe not vvee ſee the quite contrary practiſed every vvhere in the vvorld? Doth not one thinke his vvife neerer to him, and for her ſake either quits, or at leſt is cold in the profeſſion of Chriſts religion? Doe not others thinke their mother or their brethren neerer to them, and vvhen they heare Chriſt taught in the Church, if any ſaith vnto them, as here vvee finde it in my text, <hi>thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy brethren are without deſiring to ſee thee,</hi> they vvill leaue Chriſts company to feede their fancies? Doe not all thinke their humours and pleaſures and profits neerer vnto them, and for their ſakes goe to law vvith their brethren, reject all alliance they haue vvith any in Chriſt, and vvith ſlaundrings, backbitings, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, like foule birds defile their owne neſts? <hi>Moſes</hi> vvhen two Iſraelites ſtroue together, ſaid, <hi>why ſmiteſt thou thy fellow?</hi> I ſay more, vvhy ſtriue vvee, vvee are brethren? Wee may conceiue our head Ieſus Chriſt as ſaying from heaven, vvhy ſtriue you my kinſmen? vvhy make you diviſions in our family my mother and my brethren, vvhich you are? Your are all children of the ſame heavenly Father, children ſhould dwell together; members of the ſame body, members ſhould grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſouldiers of the ſame army, ſouldiers ſhould gether; ſouldiers of the ſame army, ſouldiers ſhould march together. Thus vvee are termed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let it be our care to be anſwerable to ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable appellations. And now that you have ſeene your <hi>titles</hi> and prerogatiues vvhich Chriſt beſtowes on
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8070:60"/>you, of his mother and brethren, hearken but like mothers and brethren to the <hi>propertyes</hi> required in you, which are <hi>hearing and doing,</hi> and God will make you to be ſo indeed And firſt I deſire <hi>hearing,</hi> which commeth in the next place to be handled : <hi>My mother and my brethren are they which heare the word of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo neceſſary to a Chriſtian which travells from this Egypt of miſery and oppreſſion to the heavenly Canaan, as the knowledge of the vvord of God; for by this hee is directed in his way, conducted to his port, aſſured of his ſafe arrivall. This made the Prophets ſo often to ingeminate the hearing of it vnto Gods people: <hi>Heare yee the word of the Lord yee rulers: Eſay.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heare the word of the Lord yee houſe of David, Ierem.</hi> 12.4. <hi>You ſheepheards heare the word of the Lord: Ezech.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Heare all yee old men: Ioel.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heare all yee people. Mich.</hi> 1.2. Princes, rulers, ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, people, old, young, all, lyable to this taske of hearing, in ſomuch, that our Saviour makes this the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his Sermons, <hi>hee that hath an eare to heare let him heare.</hi> But (beloved) in this place our Saviour ſeemes to goe ſomewhat farther, and as if our kinred and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him were to be confirmed by charter, makes none capable of that honour, but thoſe which can ſhew their title out of the word of God. <hi>My mother and my brethren are they which heare the word of God;</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation which I draw from hence, is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is required of all thoſe, which would bee adopted into Chriſts family, to bee diligent hearers of Gods word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I neede not be large in proving the truth of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; It is ſufficient, that hearing is the ordinary meanes vvhich Chriſt hath left vs to engraft vs into his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to make vs the children of his heavenly Father: <hi>for by faith wee are made the heires of ſalvation, and faith commeth by hearing:</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8070:61"/>ſo that no hearing, no faith; no faith, no ſalvation: <hi>Hee therefore which is of God, heares Gods voyce</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,) <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.47. And againe, <hi>my ſheepe heare my voyce. Ioh.</hi> 10.27. In regard whereof, the Saints in all ages were bound to repaire to the miniſters of the word, and <hi>to heare the Law at the Prieſts lips, Malach.</hi> 2.7. In the Old Teſtament, wee finde that they reſorted to the Prophets vpon the ſabbaths, and vpon other dayes; for when the <hi>Shunamite in</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4. craved leaue of her husband to goe to the Prophet, hee replyed <hi>wherefore wilt thou goe? it is neither new moone nor Sabbath day,</hi> as if on thoſe dayes the people vſed to reſort vnto them to heare them. The like was vſed in the new Teſtament, for ſo our Saviour <hi>ſent the Iewes to the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, Matt.</hi> 23.1. the Angell ſent <hi>Cornelius to Peter, Act.</hi> 10.32. and of theſe times <hi>Eſay</hi> prophecying, ſaith, that in the laſt dayes it ſhall come to paſſe that many people ſhall goe and ſay, <hi>Come yee, and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Iacob, and hee will teach vs his wayes, Eſay.</hi> 2.3. For indeed the miniſtery of the Goſpell is that <hi>golden pipe</hi> (as one termes it) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and wherethrough all the goodneſſe of God, all the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, all heavenly graces whatſoever are derived vnto vs; It is that <hi>hooke and bait</hi> which Chriſts fiſhers of men, his diſciples and Apoſtles vſed, in the taking of ſoules; It is that <hi>ſpirituall armour</hi> which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth downe every thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God, and bringeth into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt; It is that <hi>blowing of the Levites,</hi> which, if not at the firſt, yet at the ſeventh time, will beat downe Iericho in vs, and hew a paſſage in our hearts for the entrance of the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly tabernacle. It is that <hi>poole of Betheſda,</hi> at which ſhould lye every diſtreſſed &amp; impotent ſoule, &amp; expect the moving of the waters, I meane, the firſt moving of the ſpirituall waters of life,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8070:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the preachers of the Goſpell. To make vſe of this doctrine; there are two ſorts of men vvhich commonly faile in the performance of this commandement, of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word; the firſt are thoſe which ſay, they can reade the Bible in their houſes, that they haue Gods word which will inſtruct them as ſufficiently at home, as any ſermons in the Churches. But theſe men foulety deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for firſt they muſt know that it is one thing to ſay that the Scriptures are ſufficient to teach them all things neceſſary to ſalvation; another thing to ſay, that they teach theſe things ſo vſefully without an interpreter, as with one. I deny not but that in the Scriptures more excellent knowledge &amp; profound myſteries are contayned, then the greateſt Doctours &amp; learned'ſt men withall their paines &amp; induſtry can attaine vnto: but ſo powerfull &amp; ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it is not to them when it is read privately, as when it is preached in the Church; for who can ſay that he ſhall not heare in preaching, many things expounded which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> vvas ignorant of, many godly inſtructions gathered, which he obſerved not, many vſefull points applyed to his conſcience which he heeded not? I paſſe by his ſinnes ript vp, the weakeneſſes &amp; diſeaſes of his ſoule diſplayed to his view, the threatning of the law denounced, the ſweete comforts of the Goſpell produc'd, ſalues applyed to his ſores, balſome to his wounds, playſters to his dying &amp; putrifying members: beſides a thouſand excellent and heavenly effects, which hearing brings with it. Thou cameſt into the Church a vulture, before thou departeſt, thou maiſt bee tranſformed into a doue; thou camſt in a wolfe, thou maiſt be changed into a lambe; not having thy body or ſoule ſo altered that thou ſhalt bee no more a man, but thy foule minde, and beaſtly thoughts expelled, which before would not ſuffer thee to be a man. I adde, the hearing of the word preached is a part of the ſervice of God, and a duty enjoyned every Chriſtian to performe, if therfore other things moved vs not vnto it, yet me-thinks
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8070:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>the commandement it ſelfe ſhould be of vertue ſufficient to moue a good Chriſtian to be zealous in this kinde, to ſay with <hi>David, One thing haue I deſired of the Lord, that I will require, even that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to viſit his holy temple.</hi> At the day of judgement when all the glory of this world ſhall be as droſſe, when our riches ſhall faile vs, our honour not profit vs, our friends forſake vs, there will be nothing left vs to doe vs good, but what wee ſhall haue learnd by having heard Chriſt preached. But I paſſe to the other fort of me which offfend like wiſe, &amp; that perhaps more dangerouſly in not hearing the word preached. Theſe are they which are ſo farre from reading at home, that thinke it not greatly neceſſary for the either to reade or to heare any where; many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will pretend that they are buſied about this or that buſineſſe, they are craftsmen, they muſt follow their trade, they haue a wife, their children muſt be fed, their houſhold provided for; and laſtly, they are men of the world, a little knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> &amp; a good meaning is ſufficient for them, it is for ſchollers, and ſuch as giue themſelues to a contemplatiue life, to bee skill'd in theſe points. But alas! (my good Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) is it not for thee to apply thy ſelfe to the hearing of the word preached, becauſe thou art diſtracted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred with cares &amp; buſineſſes? why, ſo much the more it is neceſſary for thee to haue the munition of the word, by how much the more diſtreſſed thou art in worldly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; they that bee free and farre from trouble and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling of worldly things, liue in ſafegard, in tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillity, and in a calme, or within a ſure haven; Thou art in the midſt of the ſea of worldly wickedneſſe, &amp; therefore thou needeſt the more of ghoſtly ſuccour &amp; comfort; They fit farre from the ſtroakes of battaile, and farre out of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, and therefore they be but ſeldome wounded; thou that ſtandeſt in the forefront of the hoſte, &amp; nigheſt to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8070:62"/>thine enemies, muſt needes take now and then many ſtroakes, and be grievouſly wounded, and therefore thou haſt moſt neede to haue thy remedies and medicines at hand. Thy wife provoketh thee to anger, thy childe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee occaſion to take ſorrow and penſiueneſſe, thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies lye in waite for thee, thy friend (as thou takeſt him) ſometimes envies thee, thy neighbour miſreporteth thee, or picketh quarels againſt thee, thy mate or partner vndermineth thee, thy lord or ſuperiour threatneth thee, poverty is painfull vnto thee, the loſſe of thy deare and well-beloued cauſeth thee to mourne, proſperity exalteth thee, adverſity bringeth the low, and laſtly, manifold occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of cares, tribulations and temptations, do beſet thee and beſeege thee round about. Now where canſt thou haue armour or fortreſſe againſt theſe thine aſſaults? where canſt thou haue ſalue for thy ſores, but in the word of God, and in diligently hearing it preached? O therefore (beloued) ſtoppe not vppe with earth, as the <hi>Philiſtiues</hi> did, thoſe fountaines which are digged for you, neither yet with the <hi>Iewes</hi> runne to broken Ciſternes. If Chriſt come peaching vnto you, entreat him not with the <hi>Girgaſites to depart out of your coaſts;</hi> if his meſſengers are preſent to inſtruct you, ſay not as <hi>Felix did to Paul, Go thy way for this time, and when I have convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will call for thee againe,</hi> but lay hold vpon all occaſions &amp; oportunities; when angels food is offered refuſe not to taſt it, when clothing is profered, be not way ward and go naked, but remember that ſaying of a good <hi>father,</hi> he which harkneth not vnto God inviting him, ſhall be ſure to find God taking vengeance vpon him. And ſo I paſſe from the firſt <hi>property</hi> which is required in thoſe which are of Chriſts family, to wit, <hi>hearing the word,</hi> to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> which is <hi>doing of the ſame; my mother and my brethren are they which heare the word of God, and do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:8070:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>After hearing, our Saviour inculcates dooing, and that to good purpoſe, for to heare the word and not to do it yeilds rather matter of condemnation then of profit. For what ſayth the Apoſtle? It had beene better for them not to haue knowne the way of righteouſneſſe then after they haue knowne it, to turne from the holy commandement delivered vnto them. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> therefore compares them to the dogge that turnes to his owne vomit againe, and the ſow to her wallowing in the myre; Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to a man beholding his face in a glaſſe, who when hee goeth away, hee ſtraight wayes forgetteth it; and our Saviour reſembleth them to him who built his houſe vpon the ſand, which, when the raine deſcended &amp; the floods came and the winds blew, fell and great was the fall of it. All ſhew the brutiſh and ſwiniſh faſhion of thoſe which ſpurne at the pearles of the law, and like thoſe in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> which devide faith from workes, and ſay, <hi>I haue faith and thou haſt workes.</hi> What God hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together let no man ſeparate, as faith comes by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo hearing through faith muſt bee operatiue in good workes, otherwiſe no kinred nor alliance with Chriſt, we can claime no intereſt in his blood. If wee would bee his brethren wee muſt <hi>heare his owne word,</hi> and yet not ſo onely, <hi>but alſo do it:</hi> from whence I inferred this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is neceſſary for all thoſe which would claime any intereſt in Chriſt to be doers of his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the fuller explication of the which aſſertion wee muſt firſt diſtinguiſh of neceſſity, a thing may bee ſaid to be neceſſary in a double reſpect, either <hi>by way of a cauſe,</hi> and ſo the ſunne is neceſſary to make the daie becauſe it is the cauſe of it: phyſicke is neceſſary for the recovery of a mans health becauſe it is the cauſe of it: or elſe a thing may be ſaid to be neceſſary <hi>by way of an effect or of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſo heate is neceſſary to the fire, light to the ſunne,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8070:63"/>moyſtneſſe to the water, not that heate is the cauſe of the fire, nor light the cauſe of the ſunne, nor moyſtneſſe the cauſe of the water, but that the fire, and ſunne, and water, are rather the cauſes of them, and they neceſſary effects of theſe. Vpon this diſtinction depends the great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene vs and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning good workes. We agree on both ſides, that to do and performe the word of God, to do good workes, is neceſſary for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man which expecteth to be juſtified by Chriſt, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference conſiſts in this; they ſay that good workes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as being cauſes of it, we ſay they are neceſſary to juſtification only, as being effects of it: I need not inſiſt much vpon the deciding of the controverſie in theſe barren times of ours, wherein there are ſo few which do good workes, I wonder what they aile to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo much in muſing what gaine or merit ſhall accrue vnto them from them, whether it ſhall bee a merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or deſert, whether of the firſt grace or of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? when as their ſtore, me-thinks, is yet ſo ſmall, that though they ſell all they haue and become bankerupt marchants, they ſhall never bee able to purchaſſe the leaſt pearle which adornes the crowne of glory. I know that diverſe are of opinion, that it is a good pollicie to perſwade the common people as the Pope doth, that good workes are the meritorious cauſes of juſtification, &amp; ſo by a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of ſalvation, becauſe by this meanes the heat of ſin (ſay they) will bee repreſsed in many, &amp; men will bee the more carefull in the performance of good deeds. But were theſe men either well catechiſed in their religion, or elſe were any whit skilled in the writings of the adverſe party, I doubt not but they would ſoone perceiue, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of works addes fewell rather to increaſe the flame of bad deſires in one, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any way extinguiſheth or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vigour of it. For beſides that they teach that many groſſe &amp; hainous ſins are no ſins, &amp; that they mince many
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8070:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>and of mortall make them veniall, ſay that the hope of the reward for their good workes &amp; the feare of puniſhment either in hell or in purgatory for their bad, do ſomething moue &amp; rouſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to performe good deedes, yet judge you (beloued) whether the eaſy avoiding of thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they haue deviſed will not as much giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> courage to goe on in ſin &amp; perſevere in the way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Why, marke but a little their doctrine; in any ſinne there are theſe two parts, <hi>the guilt of it, &amp; the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;</hi> the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they make to be twofold, the <hi>one eternall,</hi> which is in hell, the <hi>other temporall,</hi> wherewith (ſay they) God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflicts men in this life, or elſe in purgatory whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are dead. Now would you know how eaſie a matter they make it to be freed from the guilt of ſin, &amp; from hell fire? Why <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will ſoone reſolue you for that, &amp; tell you that theſe are taken away by confeſſing of ones ſins to the Prieſt, &amp; by receiuing an abſolution fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, <hi>in his</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <hi>booke de poenit. &amp;</hi> 17. <hi>ch.</hi> which kinde of contrition and ſorrow for ones ſinnes, if it be ſufficient, I make no queſtion but that the divell himſelfe might bee abſolved from his ſinnes; for beſides that hee trembles, which argues that hee is poſſeſt with ſuch a feare as this; Saint <hi>Iames</hi> tells vs moreover that he beleeues, which I think is more then many Papiſts do, who content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with an implicit faith (as they terme it) and a blind zeale: but becauſe when the guilt and the puniſhment of hell fire is taken away they teach that God leaues a temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to bee vndergone by them, either in this life, or after this life in purgatory, you ſhall ſee that the meanes to avoid that will bee, as caſie as the former. For to omit
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8070:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>more going about then needes; if they would take a ſpeedy way, it is but purchaſing an Indulgence of the Pope, they may haue <hi>plenam, pleniorem, pleniſſimam,</hi> as they terme them, for halfe their ſins, or for one third or fourth part, or if the Pope pleaſe, for all, as wee may well ſee in <hi>Bellarm: his</hi> 1. <hi>booke de Indulgent: chap.</hi> 9. Who would not bee a Papiſt if he were deſirous to liue as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted? When beſides the Indulgences, for a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Ave-Maryes</hi> (repeated at ſome altars, which the Pope appoints) he may haue a pardon for more yeares then the world is like to continue? But to leaue them a while to themſelues, it ſhall be enough at this time to ſhew you, that howſoever we holde not good workes to be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſalvation, nor yet that we are to merite Heauen by them, as they doe; yet that wee make them abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thoſe which are the heires of ſalvation; and ſo withall that our doctrine rightly conſidered, doth more neceſſarily require them of vs, then the Papiſts doe. For <hi>firſt,</hi> wee holde them to bee neceſſary, in <hi>reſpect, of God,</hi> that his Commandement may bee obeyed, that his will may be done, that wee ſhew our ſelues obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnto him, that wee bee thankefull for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by CHRIST, that wee may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we hold them to bee neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in <hi>regard of our neighbours,</hi> that they may bee helped, that they may be wonne by our example, and that by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, the mouthes of our adverſaries may be ſtopped. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we hold good workes neceſſary <hi>for our ſelues,</hi> and that notably in theſe reſpects. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that wee may haue ſome aſſurance of our faith, and of our ſalvation; for when wee cannot diſcerne our faith, whether it bee a true and liuely one or no, but onely by the workes which it bringeth foorth, as the tree is not knowne but by his fruite, it greatly concernes all thoſe which would over-come all temptations at their death,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8070:65"/>to make good proofe of their faith in their life, which is the thing pointed at by the Apoſtle <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his 2. Ep. and 1. Chap: where he ſaith, <hi>giue diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> And herein the Schooles afford vs a good diſtinction, and tell vs, that <hi>aliud eſt fiduciam ponere in operibus, aliud fiduciam oriri ex operibus;</hi> it is one thing to put ones confidence in ones workes, another thing to haue a confidence from ones workes, though wee put not the confidence of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alvation in our workes, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe, yet we holde that a confidence of our ſalvation may ariſe vnto vs from our workes, becauſe our workes doe teſtifie our faith, whether it be a liuely one, or no. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> we hold good workes are neceſſary for vs, becauſe though the hauing of them deſerues not Heauen, yet the not hauing of them merits Hell. It was a good anſwere therefore which a godly man made vnto one, who asked him, what if there were no Heauen, wherewith ſhould his auſterity and mortification be recompenſed? He reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what if there bee an hell wherewith thy vices ſhall be puniſhed? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that we may receiue temporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites in this life, and avoide temporall puniſhments, which otherwiſe God will inflict vpon vs, if wee doe amiſſe; for ſo ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Godlines is profitable vnto all things, hauing promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>chap</hi> But I haſten to my application. This ſerues (beloved) for a caveat to thoſe which put all their holines in hearing, and thinke that will ſerue their turnes, though they neuer doe any thing. Many there be in theſe dayes of ours, whoſe not onely eares are bent to hearing, but alſo their tongues are ready whet to all vnprofitable diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whom I could wiſh, as they be prompt of hearing, and vehement in reaſoning, ſo they were as ready &amp; practiue to do good deedes. I mervaile to recount whereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth this ſtrange hypocriſie, whence it happeneth, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt beginneth to waxe nothing elſe but as it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8070:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>were a ſophiſtry and talking-craft. Wee heare the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and we heare preaching, but in the meane time wee ſubdue not our ſelues by faſting, watching, and weeping, wee make not this life a meditation of death, wee doe not ſtriue to be Lords ower our appetites and affections, we go not about to pull downe our proud and high mindes, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate our fumiſh &amp; rancorous ſtomacks, to reſtraine our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet ſorrowes, our laſcivious mirths, our inordinate thoughts, our inſatiable hearing of vanities: but all our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines conſiſts in talking or hearing, &amp; wee pardon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all good living, ſo wee may ſticke faſt together in argumentation. What ſhould I ſtand in perſwading you to goodnes, whereas no day nor houre paſſeth, wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not ſome ſilent ſermon, or reall perſwaſion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide ſinne, &amp; practiſe goodness? If you cannot be induced vnto it, becauſe of its owne pulchritude, becauſe it carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a ſhew of honeſtie, ſuch a grace and excellencie, that the action it ſelfe may bee a ſufficient remuneration; yet for your ſoules ſake let me perſwade you vnto it. I know whilſt you are in your flouriſhing time, you are free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all deſpaires or feares of deſertion; but when the dayes of temptation ſhall come vpon you, and Sathan like a hard creditour ſhall moſt preſſe, when you are leaſt able to ſtand vpright; in ſo dangerous a conflict, againſt ſo ſubtile an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, how will you bee able to maintaine your owne right? Hee'll tell you, you haue no right nor intereſt in Chriſt's family, you haue no portion with his brethren, for no vnrighteous perſon ſhall inherit the kingdome of God; youll reply that you ſtand not vpon your workes, neither expect, as the Papiſtes doe, to be juſtified by merites; but your faith in Chriſt is that Helmet of ſalvation, &amp; the hand which layes hold vpon the heauenly promiſes. True, hee'l anſwere, but how can you aſſure your ſelues that you haue true faith? That you cannot judge of, but by the fruits; When bad company enticed you to intemperancie, did
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8070:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>you reſiſt them? when wealth and preferment tempted you, did you forgoe them, rather than commit any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt action? when your acquaintance or friends perſwaded you to any wrong courſe, did you for the truth's cauſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gainſay them? when your enemies reviled you, did you bleſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? when they ſought your vndoing, did you pray for them? theſe things will ſhew whether your faith be a liuely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faith or no; and theſe queſtions you muſt be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to anſwere vnto, if you would be able to refute the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel's ſophiſtry. But perhaps I may finde many ſo ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that they ſhall haue no feeling of their eſtate, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the world to come; becauſe repentance never comes too late; the Theeſe vpon the Croſſe found mercy, and therefore why not they vpon their death-beds a more likely place? Well, ſay that he may finde mercie at the laſt, though no merveile (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) if at the laſt gaſpe he forget himſelfe, who in all his life neglected, to remember GOD; but ſuppoſe the beſt that may bee hoped for, yet conſider herein thy fooliſhneſſe, which in matters of leſſe moment thou would'ſt bee loath to commit; each day thou knitteſt knots, which once thou muſt vndoe againe; thou heapeſt that together, which one thou muſt diſperſe againe; thou eateſt and drinkeſt that hourely, which once thou muſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vp againe, to omit thy vngratefull dealing with thy Lord and Maſter IESVS CHRIST, whom thou ſerveſt thus at the length with the divel's lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings: and then (forſooth) wee will turne to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, when time will ſcarce permit vs to be wicked any longer. O what a ſenſeleſneſſe is it, to make that the taske of thy death, which ſhould be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all thy life! and to ſettle thine everlaſting, thine onely and ſureſt Making and Marring, vpon ſo tottering, and ſinking, and ſandy a foundation! Wee ſee and know by experience, that a ſhip the longer it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8070:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>leaketh, the harder it is to bee emptied; a houſe, the longer it goeth to decay, the worſe it is to repaire; or a nayle, the farther it is driven in, the harder it is to plucke out againe; And can wee perſwade our ſelues, that the trembling hands, the ſhaking joynts, the dazled eyes, the fainting heart, the fayling legges of vnweldy drooping and vndiſciplinable olde age, may empty, repaire, plucke out, the leakes, and ruines, and nayles of ſo many yeares flowing, fayling, and faſtening? But imagine thou thinkeſt not of the Kingdome of GOD, becauſe thou conceiueſt thy ſelfe to bee too ſure of it already, yet the horrible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments mentioned in the Scriptures, inflicted for ſinne euen in this life (if thou hadſt grace) might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes, inforce doing good vpon thee. For what caſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> out of Paradiſe? ſinne: what wounded him in nature, &amp; ſpoyled him of grace? ſinne: what brought firſt hunger and thirſt into the world, but his gluttonie? What made ſo many poore men, ſuch a number of beggars, but his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall theft? What cauſed our dayes to bee ſo ſhort, that many drop away in the very prime of their yeares, but his inordinate appetite of divinity, and conſequently of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Many examples could I bring out of the Olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as deaths of private men and Princes, ſubverſions of Armies, diſperſions of Countryes, mortality of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, famine, warres &amp; plagues, captivities &amp; impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for no other cauſe inflicted, then ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But I will giue you this one leſſon for all, and it is a point worthy your obſerving, that howſoever God ſuffers the vngodly oftentimes to liue in great proſperity, and as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayth, <hi>to flouriſh like a greene bay tree;</hi> yet let thoſe which hope for any part of inheritance with Chriſt, expect for certainty, that if they be not allured to well-doing by Gods bleſſings, that at length they ſhall bee deterred from ill-doing by his chaſtiſements.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8070:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>For it is a true ſaying, <hi>Whom the Lord loueth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth euery ſonne whom he receiueth.</hi> All ſinnes therefore (ſaith <hi>Auſelme</hi>) be they great, or be they ſmall, they ſhall be puniſhed; heere's onely the difference, if wee crucify our ſelues vnto the world, and ſo we firſt abandon it, <hi>plectuntur homine puniente,</hi> they are puniſhed man cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them; if God crucify the world vnto vs, and ſo make it and the glory thereof firſt to forſake vs, <hi>plectuntur Deo iudicante,</hi> they are puniſhed God adjudging them. It is a fearefull thing (beloued) to fall into the hands of the liuing God. He therefore which only beholdeth the hearts of all men, and turneth them which way it ſeemeth beſt to his godly wiſdome, vnite our hearts to ſerue him, and through him to loue one another; that being not onely hearers of his Word, but alſo doers of the ſame, we may be adopted into Chriſt's family, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſonnes of our Heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to raigne with him for evermore.</p>

            <p>COncerning the Ceremoniall law, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> treates throughout this whole Epiſtle, I finde a differing practice of the Apoſtles. A while after our Saviour's death, they retain'd the vſe of it, at the leaſt in many things; becauſe a ſuddaine abrogation carries a ſhew of violence, and breedes an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of contempt; whereas <hi>Mater Synagoga</hi> (faith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 19. <hi>Ep. ad Hieronym.</hi>) <hi>cum honore ſepelienda erat;</hi> the Mother the Synagogue was to be buried honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8070:68"/>ſhee was to bee brought to her ſepulchre by her ſonnes, and not by a preſent forſaking, be expoſed to the biting of dogges, and reproaches of the enemy. In which reſpect, leſt a prejudicate opinion ſhould fore-ſtall the Iewes, and make them conceiue that the Apoſtles held their ceremonies in deteſtation, as things impious and abominable: we reade how the Apoſtles <hi>counſelled the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles for a time to abſtaine from things ſtrangled, and from blood, Act.</hi> 15. how <hi>S. Paul circumciſed Timothy, Act.</hi> 16: <hi>and purified and ſhaved himſelfe with foure others, Act.</hi> 21. all tending to no other end then this, (ſaith that Father) that the Iewes might ſee the nature of their ceremonies, that they ought <hi>nec tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſaria appeti, nec tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaria damnari;</hi> neither bee deſired, nor yet condemned as things neceſſary. But when the Goſpell was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſettled, and the Iewes by infallible proofes convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that all ſacrifices and circumciſions ended with the ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſus vpon the Croſſe, then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tooke the Synagogue to bee as buried; and that hee which by a revocation of the ceremoniall law, ſhould diſturbe her aſhes where they lay in queit; would adde nothing to what ſhee had in honour, but rake her out of her graue, and ſhew her wanne and dead corps to the world with diſhonour. Before, even as ſoone as her Spouſe yeelded vp the Ghoſt, they acknowledged her to be <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuam;</hi> but afterwards when they had divulged her death, and rung as it were her knell, they proclaimed her to be not onely <hi>mortuam,</hi> dead; but alſo to bee <hi>mortiferam,</hi> deadly. When therefore in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> ſome miſtaking perhaps the reaſon of the Apoſtles applying themſelues at the beginning to the Iewiſh cuſtomes, would yet continue in them, and ſeeke to reconcile Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme with Chriſtianity, to advance the liberty of the one, and yet to bring in the bondage of the other; make one Religion of two, or elſe in the exerciſe of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8070:68"/>the one, joyne as a thing neceſſary the outward rites and ceremonies of the other; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> valiantly withſtand's them; though before hee had circumciſed <hi>Tymothy,</hi> which was to go amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> yet <hi>Titus</hi> hee would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be circumciſed, who was to preach vnto the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; firſt</hi> ſee in my text a <hi>couragious and reſolute oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, To whom wee gaue place by ſubjection, no not for an houre. Secondly, an vrgent motiue or induction, that the truth of the goſpell might continue with you;</hi> all directing vs to this concluſion,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That reconciling of other religions, with that which alone is allowed and approued of God, is to bee withſtood, as being moſt dangerous to overthrow, and corrupt the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more deſtructiue in nature, then the combining and vniting of contraries, fire the moſt actiue element, if you apply once water to it, is extinguiſhed; a little leaven leavens the whole lumpe, the ſtarres them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in conjunction with ſtarres of other tempers, do change their influence and operation; and from ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous engendrings of beaſts of diverſe kinds, ſprung that ancient proverbe, <hi>Africa ſemper aliquid apportat novi.</hi> Africa is ever brought a-bed of ſome ſtrange, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth monſter. And as it fares in nature, ſo doth it in divinity; there hath nothing proued more dangerous and hurtfull in it, then a reconciling of truth with falſehood, a medly of religions, and a too facile perſwaſion to admit errour within the pale of verity. Hence was it that God by way of embleme, and as in a mirrour teaching vs how farre wee ſhould ever ſet a ſunder worſhips of divers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>forbids mingled ſeede, a plow of an oxe and an aſſe, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of linſey-woolſey.</hi> The neglect of this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produced that pernicious hereſie of <hi>Samaritaniſme</hi> before Chriſt; they which turned from captivity would bee <hi>Iewes</hi> forſooth in profeſſion; and yet becauſe they thought their idolatrous worſhip was nothing oppoſite
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8070:69"/>to this courſe, therefore the text ſaith, <hi>that they feared the Lord and ſerved their owne Gods.</hi> 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 17. It was that which hatched <hi>Semi-pelagianiſme, Semi-arrianiſme</hi> in the Primitiue Church; and it is evident that <hi>Mahomets</hi> firſt poſition was this, that all men might bee ſaved by their owne religion whatſoever it were; and ſo compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Chriſtianity, Iudaiſme, and Paganiſme, that moſt peſtilent <hi>Alcaron,</hi> the <hi>Turkes divinity. Herod</hi> had a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of indifferencie in this kinde, and as if the Prophets had beene turbulent ſpirits in exclaiming ſo againſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, hee would bee a Iew with the Iew, and an Ethnick with the Ethnickes, build a Temple to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and to the true God (ſayth <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) at the ſame time. <hi>Iulian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi> followeth him, but it was with a more divelliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, hee gaue heretickes freedome amongſt true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, not that hee cared for either, but that by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall diſtractions hee might deſtroy both. <hi>Tunc enim reddidit Baſilicas haereticis</hi> (ſayth Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi>) <hi>quando templa daemoniis:</hi> he reſtored at the ſame time Churches to heretickes, and Temples to divels. The beſt adviſed therefore, and moſt judicious haue in all ages reſiſted with might and maine theſe crafty divices of the divell, who, when hee knowes errour to bee too weake whilſt it ſtands in hoſtile oppoſition with the truth; would yet ſeeke to advance it by way of friendſhip and amity. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was that reſolution of Saint <hi>Baſill to the preſident of Valence the Emperour,</hi> who deſired him to yeeld to ſome moderation and not to make ſuch a rent in the Church for ſmall ſubtilties; Thoſe which are throughly ſeaſon'd with true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will rather ſuffer all kinds of death, then giue way for the altering of one ſyllable.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8070:69"/>
               <hi>Ireneus</hi> hath written, It is better not to ſearch the cauſes of things, and to know nothing but Ieſus Chriſt, then by ſubtilties ad bablings to fall into impiety; and that of <hi>Hillary,</hi> that God calls vs not to happineſſe by hard que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; and againe <hi>Dulce pacis nomen,</hi> that the name of peace ſhould be ſweete amongſt Chriſtians, yet both of theſe, do they not with what vehemency they can oppoſe errours? How many labyrinths and perplexities is <hi>Irene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> compelled to rippe vp, that hee might freç the truth from prodigious fallacies? how ſollicitous and earneſt was <hi>Hillary</hi> in diſſolving the cavils of the <hi>Arrians:</hi> ſhall wee terme theſe Fathers contentious, or rather good and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſouldiers? that where Chriſt proclaimed warre, and ſayd he came not to ſend peace, but the ſword, they would not bee ſo inconſiderate, as to treat on the Articles of peace. The Iewiſh ceremonies, you know, had beene ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their time, and God had vſed them before, as the firſt letters of the booke to ſchoole his people with; yet the Goſpell of Chriſt beeing planted in the Church of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> might haue no copartnerſhip with them; in this chapter Saint <hi>Paul</hi> relates how he withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> to the face, for admitting of them, ingeminates anathema to ſuch as Preached otherwiſe, and proteſts vnto them, not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his face, nor diſſembling his name, <hi>Behold,</hi> I <hi>Paul, ſay vnto you, that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Now when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> together were ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue to him, he would never haue heard of a reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation betweene <hi>Chriſt and Belial, light and darkeneſſe, righteouſneſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe, the Temple of God and Idols, the cup of the Lord and the cup of divels,</hi> in the communion whereof hee noteth an impoſſibility in <hi>both his Epiſtles to the Corinthians.</hi> If therefore the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and attoning of truth and falſehood, bee ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in Gods pure eyes, and ſo dangerous to his Church,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8070:70"/>with what colour can ſome in our dayes, take in hand the reconciling <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> at the leaſt, as they pretend in all matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and points neceſſary to ſalvation: I feare it is not a generall agreement which they aime at on both ſides, which is as impoſſible to effect, as to bring the Northerne and Southerne pole into one center, but rather as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> well notes, to gaiue a liberty to themſelues in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and a plauſible acceptance , at the adverſe partie. This taske I finde enterprized by divers, firſt <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> who was ſet on worke by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the Emperours, to compoſe if poſſibly hee could, the diſſentions of the Church, wrote his conſultation of it, and thought that a meane betwixt the rigid <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> was beſt; whiles the one might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſomewhat of their pride, and needeleleſſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; the other, hard conſtructions of the Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, which though they might bee falſe, yet hee tooke them not to bee ſo dangerous as they were conceiued. To him wee may joyne <hi>Andreas Friſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us de emendanda repub.

After theſe, others haue continued the plea, in <hi>Germany</hi> the <hi>Interremiſts,</hi> in <hi>France hec, whoſoever hec were, that wrote the pacificall diſcourſe, to proue that Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of good right may bee accounted members of the Roman Church.</hi> With what ſucceſſe or applauſe, the world hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued theſe treatyes of peace, I leaue to thoſe to judge who haue obſerved with what violence and indignation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8070:70"/>theſe ſubtle practiſes of the Pope haue from time to time beene reſiſted. It is not amity and vnion which our men haue in theſe things rejected; as farre as they can in all contoverſies, the moſt learned haue diſtinctly ſet downe the pointes of agreement; but they ſaw the fraud of the enemy, and therefore preferred juſt warre before an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt peace. Temporall princes might reſpect herein the quiet of their ſtate, but the Popes inſtruments gaine doubly by it; for <hi>firſt,</hi> they would by bringing vs to the vnity of their Church, keepe vs in obedience to the See of Rome: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by working an opinion of agreement in the mayneſt pointes of religion, winne vs to come over to them the more eaſily in all pointes. It ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be amiſſe, by way of prevention, to ſhew ſomewhat of this matter, and though it would be over long to runne through the differences betweene particular writers on both ſides which are infinite, and perhaps not ſo evident, to proue to all men my poſition; yet the ſtate of theſe dangerous times, (wherein too many doe fall from cooling to benumbedneſſe, from ſlackenes to defection, from indifferency to ſenceleſneſſe, and a loathing of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,) doth require that ſomewhat bee ſet downe out of the allowed bookes, and writings eſtabliſhed by both Churches, whether the differences in fundamentall points bee ſuch, as hitherto we haue made the world to beleeue. That wee may not bee miſtaken or thought over hot in parting the fray to make it greater, I will ſet downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine concluſions, wherein wee will not greatly diſſent from theſe peace-makers in this queſtion. <hi>Firſt, it is one thing to ſpeake of the Church of Rome before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, and another thing to ſpeake of it ſince the Councell of Trent.</hi> I graunt that before the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> though in many things there was a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and them, yet in moſt of greateſt moment, there was not the preciſe difference betweene vs as is now,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8070:71"/>which happened, partly, becauſe that the Church of Rome had not ſo ſtrictly defined thoſe tenents in any Councell before that time, as it did then; partly, becauſe though the current of the greater faction ran the quite contrary way, yet they which were of our opinion ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelues to the obedience of the Church of Rome, which <hi>Luther</hi> did not. So that if any aske, where was <hi>our Church before Luthers riſing?</hi> I anſwere, it was in <hi>Rome, and the Romane Iuriſdiction; perhaps not in the Popes privy chamber, yet in his Court amongſt his greateſt counſellours, agents, doctours, writers, prelates.</hi> Then did <hi>Gregorius, Ariminenſis</hi> doubt how any ſuch place as <hi>Limbus puerorum</hi> might ſtand with the doctrine of the primitiue Church; then did <hi>Richardus de Sancto Victore, Gerſon and Durand,</hi> deny that diſtinction of veniall and mortall ſinnes; then did <hi>Scotus, Cameracenſis,</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis</hi> refute thoſe merits of congruity and condignity; <hi>Bernard</hi> with others, juſtification by inherent qualities; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did the <hi>M. of the Sentences</hi> not once me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; <hi>Bonaventure</hi> doubted of it; <hi>Cajetan</hi> confeſ'd, that though in word moſt doe affirme it, yet in deed many deny it, thinking nothing leſſe. Then did many (ſaith <hi>Bacon</hi>) deny that Purgatory could bee proved by Scriptures: <hi>Willielmus Altiſiodorenſis</hi> ſaid, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of his time, that wee neither doe properly pray to Saints, nor Saints for vs: Then did <hi>Mirandula</hi> withſtand worſhipping of images; the <hi>Sorboniſtes</hi> the Popes infallibility; <hi>many</hi> his indulgences and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; and moſt good men his Iuriſdiction in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall affaires of princes: So that hee which ſhall ſeeke reconciliation betweene vs and them, (becauſe before the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> wee jumpt in opinions with many of their men, or at leſt not greatly ſwarv'd from them) will fight very much without an enemy, and forgets that the Papiſts by the Church, which they would vnder paine
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8070:71"/>of damnation, binde every man to beleeue, vnderſtand not the Church which was ſixty or an hundred yeares ſince, but the preſent Church, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and their great Doctours doe interpret. <hi>Secondly, wee diſtinguiſh of Romane Catholickes,</hi> whereof, as in all religions, ſo in theirs, <hi>ſome are more moderate,</hi> and (whether through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their owne doctrine, or through an impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of judgement, as divers learned men in France, or through an accuſation of their conſcience, as moſt at the time of death, eſpecially touching the doctrine of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) doe greatly incline to our tenents; <hi>others are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Romaniſts</hi> both in letter and title, and ſwarne not a whit from the determination of the Church. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I leaue in this controverſie, the demonſtration of the probleme ſhall bee in the latter. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe wee propoſe the queſtion, whether wee and they doe differ not onely in lighter matters, but alſo in thoſe which concerne the foundation of religion; leſt any ſhould miſconceiue our meaning, let vs adde a third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <hi>that a foundation of religion is overthrow'd two wayes;</hi> either in <hi>flat termes,</hi> when a maine principle of faith is abſolutely denyed, as the deity, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiality of the Sonne, by <hi>Arrius;</hi> the trinity of the perſons by <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Servetus;</hi> the reſurrection of the body by <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus;</hi> and the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>S Peters mockers;</hi> or 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
               <hi>by conſequent,</hi> when any opinion is maintained, which by juſt ſequell over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth the truth of that principle which the defendant profeſſeth to hold. So the <hi>Minaei,</hi> of whom S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ierome</hi> ſpeakes, whil'ſt they vrged circumciſion, by conſequent according to <hi>Paules</hi> rule, rejected Chriſt; ſo the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> whil'ſt they defended a full perfection of our righteouſneſſe in our ſelues, by a conſequent overthrew Chriſts juſtification. Popery comes in the latter ranke, it pronounceth the ſame wordes of the Bible, &amp; beleeues
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8070:72"/>them; it repeates the ſame Creed <hi>Apoſtolique, Nicene,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> and adheres to it; but it denyes each article by a conſequent, becauſe it denyes the true expoſition of the article. <hi>Non enim in verbis, ſed in ſenſu fides eſt,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>nec idem ſymbolum habemus, ſi in explicatione diſſidemus:</hi> Our beliefe ſtayes not it ſelfe vpon the words, but vpon the ſenſe, nor haue wee the ſame Creed if we differ in the explanation of it. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Novatians, Neſtorians,</hi> and almoſt all heretickes haue ever agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame Creed; but becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed not vpon the meaning of it, they therefore conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may bee ſaid to deny it. The ſtate therefore of our poſition in ſumme is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a pure profeſt Romaniſt, which ſtrictly adheres to the doctrine of the Pope and of the Romane Church, ſince the Councell of Trent; doth differ from this reformed Church of ours, in ſuch fundamentall pointes, that, if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, yet by a conſequence, wee muſt needes hold him to deny ſundry articles of faith, and therefore all hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proofe of which aſſertion, becauſe I will not ſtand vpon ſuch differences as perhaps ariſe betwixt private perſons on both ſides, I will take for the Papiſts ſide the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> begun in the yeare 1545 , celebrated by <hi>three Popes, Paulus tertius, Iulius tertius,</hi> and <hi>Pius quartus,</hi> received by all ſucceeding Popes, and vnder paine of <hi>Anathema</hi> or curſe, enjoyned to be beleeved by all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks: For our ſide I will take <hi>the booke of Articles, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melyes, and ſuch bookes, as to which wee all doe ſubſcribe.</hi> And that wee may the better proceed in ſuch pointes as may cauſe a ſeparation from a Church, let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe things which the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>article</hi> makes to bee the notes of a Church, to wit, <hi>the pure preaching of the Word, and the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi> Now the controverſie betwixt vs &amp; the Church of Rome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8070:72"/>concerning the preaching of the Word, are either <hi>of the Word it ſelfe,</hi> or <hi>of the things delivered in the Word.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, wee agree that it is infallible, but we differ mainely three manner of wayes: <hi>firſt, in ſetting downe what is Scripture and what is not.</hi> The <hi>Councell of Trent in the fourth Seſſion, reckons vp all thoſe bookes which we terme A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha, to be Canonicall;</hi>and ſaith, that the Church doth <hi>pari pietatis affectu ac reverentiâ ſuſcipere &amp; venerari,</hi> receiue them with the ſame reverence and affection, as it doth the other bookes of the Old or New Teſtaments Our <hi>booke of Articles in the ſixth Article ſaith of theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha bookes,</hi> that the Church doth reade them (as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> ſaith) for example of life and inſtruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to eſtabliſh any doctrine. So then it doth not receiue them with the ſame reverence &amp; affection, as it doth the other. <hi>Secondly, we differ in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scriptures:</hi> The <hi>Councell of Trent in the ſame Seſſion,</hi> forbids any man to interprete the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>contra eum ſenſum, quem tenuit, aut tenet ſancta ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eccleſia,</hi> contrary to the ſenſe which the holy mother the Church hath held or doth hold; by the Church (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine in his</hi> 3 <hi>booke de verbo Dei, and</hi> 3 <hi>chap.</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Pontificem cum Concilio,</hi> the Pope in a Councell, in which opinion hee affirmes all Catholickes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre. Our <hi>booke of Articles in the ſixteenth art.</hi> ſaith, that a generall Councell, for as much as it is but an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of men whereof all are not governed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Word of God, may erre, and ſometime hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even in things pertayning to God. And therefore, it holdeth not with the Church of Rome, that the Church, much leſſe the Pope in a Councell, is the infallible expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Scriptures, which none may vpon any ground whatſoever gaineſay. <hi>Thirdly, wee differ concerning the perfection of the Scriptures. The Councell of Trent in the ſame Seſſion,</hi> ſuppoſing the Scriptures not to containe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8070:73"/>all things neceſſary to ſalvation, enjoynes the world to embrace with like reſpect as wee doe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>traditiones ſine ſcripto tum ad fidem tum ad mores pertinentes,</hi> vnwritten traditions pertayning as well to faith as to manners. <hi>Our Articles in the</hi> 6 <hi>Art.</hi> ſaith, that the holy Scripture contayneth all things neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may bee proved thereby, is not to bee required of any man, that it ſhould bee believed as an article of faith, or bee thought requiſite or neceſſary to ſalvation, well then, whereas it is required that every rule ſhould be knowne; <hi>firſt,</hi> what it is, otherwiſe it cannot without much vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty direct: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> how it is to be vnderſtood, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee cannot vſe it: <hi>thirdly,</hi> that it be perfect and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, otherwiſe it will not ſerue the turne; why then, ſee that wee, and the Church of Rome differ in the rule it ſelfe, in the interpretation of it, and in the perfection of it; now they which are ſo diverſe in deſcribing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and very rule of their faith, I much marvaile, if they agree in the ſubſtance of it: But let vs come now to the thing delivered in the Word: it is neceſſary for every Chriſtian, which would be reſtored to the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſonnes of God, to haue a two-fold knowledge, <hi>the one,</hi> in what miſerable an eſtate he is in; <hi>the other,</hi> how, and by what meanes he may be freed from this miſery; if I know not my diſeaſe, I ſhall not ſeeke to the phyſitian for reliefe; and if I know not how to vſe and apply my phyſicke, I am yet in the ſame caſe of deſpaire. To omit leſſer differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, let vs ſee whether in thoſe pointes which are neceſſary to the knowledge of theſe things the Church of Rome and we doe ſo farre differ, as that a moderate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may not reconcile vs, and make vs one. To begin with our ſtate and miſery. The <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> doth ſundry wayes leſſen our miſerable ſtate &amp; condition; <hi>firſt,</hi> by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling originall ſin, &amp; making concupiſcence no part of it;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8070:73"/>the words in the 5 <hi>Seſſion</hi> are theſe; <hi>hanc concupiſcentiam quam aliquando Apoſtolus peccatum appellat, ſancta Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus declarat Eccleſiam Catholicam nunquam intellexiſſe peccatum appellari,</hi> &amp;c: this concupiſcence which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Apoſtle calls ſinne, the holy Councell doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the Catholicke Church never vnderſtood it to be call'd a ſinne, as if it were truely &amp; properly a ſinne in the regenerate; but only becauſe it came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, &amp; doth incline to ſinne: Againe, the <hi>Councell</hi> pronounce than <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> or curſe, to thoſe which affirme, that by the grace which is conferr'd in baptiſme, <hi>non tolli totum id quod veram &amp; propriam rationem peccati habet;</hi> that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath the nature of ſinne, or may be ſo term'd in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, is not taken away. Wee yeelde, that in thoſe which are baptiſed, and are regenerate, originall ſinne is taken away in reſpect of the guilt; ſo that it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to vs, and in reſpect of that abſolute rule which before it had in vs; becauſe, though it be, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>a law in our members warring againſt the law of our minde;</hi> yet hath it not that full ſway in vs after regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it had before, by reaſon that it is ſuppreſſed greatly by the grace of God. But that concupiſcence is no parte of it, or that it remaineth not vnder the title of ſinne after baptiſme, our <hi>booke of Articles</hi> flatly denies, both <hi>in the ninth Article,</hi> where it ſaith, And this infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature (namely originall ſinne) doth remaine, yea even in them that are regenerate, whereby the luſt of the fleſh, called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſome doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the wiſedome, ſome ſenſuality, ſome the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome the deſire of the fleſh, is not ſubject to the law of God; and although there is no condemnation to them that belieue &amp; are baptiſed, yet the Apoſtle doth confeſſe, that concupiſcence and luſt hath of it ſelfe the nature of ſinne, ſo as for originall ſinne, you ſee our tenents are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and can no way be reconcil'd: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the <hi>Councell
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8070:74"/>of Trent</hi> leſſens our eſtate of miſery, not only in diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is <hi>malum culpae,</hi> an evill (as the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay) of ſinne, but alſo in patching vp other defects which are term'd <hi>malum poenae,</hi> an evill of puniſhment; to wit, by attributing to the ſoule <hi>free will:</hi> Wee graunt <hi>firſt,</hi> that wee haue a freedome of will in all reſpects; as free imports as much, as not conſtrayned or compelled, for God compells vs not to any thing contrary to our minde, but moues and ſollicites, as it were, our mindes with his grace, to will willingly what hee would haue vs to will: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> we graunt that in naturall, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and bad actions, we haue a freedome of will, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is taken for a power, even before regeneration; and in ſupernaturall and divine actions after regeneration, though ſomewhat imperfectly, and thus farre the Papiſts and we agree. The queſtion is, what freedome the will hath in reſpect of ſupernaturall good workes, either in generall before regeneration, or more particularly in the worke of regeneration. As for theſe workes in generally, <hi>the Councell of Trent in the</hi> 6 <hi>Seſſion, and</hi> 7 <hi>Can.</hi> ſaith, that whoſoever affirmes that all workes which are done before juſtification, howſoever they are done, to be truely ſins, or to deſerue the hatred of God, let him be accurſed. Our 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Article</hi> ſaith, contrary; workes done before the grace of Chriſt and the inſpiration of the ſpirit, are not pleaſant to God, for as much as they ſpring not of faith in Chriſt Ieſus; yea rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but that they haue the nature of ſinne; <hi>Our Article is directly oppoſ'd to their Canon.</hi> As for the worke of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> hath provided for that <hi>in the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>and</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Can.</hi> and puts downe, that whoſoever affirmes the will of man to be extinct, or as dead &amp; meerely paſſiue in theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, let him be accurſed; whereas <hi>our</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Article</hi> allowes the will, no ſtrength nor power to do any good thing, till it be, as it were, revived by the grace of God preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting vs.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8070:74"/>Wherevpon ſay ſome of our <hi>league-makers,</hi> the difference betweene the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in <hi>Freewill,</hi> is onely this: they both compare a man after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to a priſoner; the one conceiues that hee cannot come out of this priſon becauſe hee is bound onely, as the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> the other, becauſe hee is not only bound but dead alſo, as the <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> both acknowledge that God is hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom they cannot bee freed from this eſtate of thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; only the <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſayes, that God needes but only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his bonds, and then hee can come out of himſelfe, whereas the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſeemes to increaſe his mercie, and ſay's he muſt not only looſe his bonds, but alſo reſtore him to life. Now for as much as both do attribute the power of comming out of priſon to God; what great danger ſay they, is in either opinion, which ſhould ſo ſet vs at oddes about it? But theſe obſerue not the whole difference: ſay that wee both acknowledge God to bee him which giues vs power to come out of priſon; yet if hee leaue vs there, and perſwades vs not ſo effectually, that we not only may, but alſo will come out: if being wounded, the chirurgian giues mee a plaſter, and then leaues mee to apply it to my wound, if I will, or otherwiſe not, why ſurely I muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the immediate cauſe of my deliverance or cure to my ſelfe, and not to the other, which vnties my bonds, or giues mee my plaſter; Now what ſayth the <hi>Councell of Trent, in the</hi> 4. <hi>Canon and</hi> 6. <hi>Seſſion;</hi> whoſoever ſayth, that the free will of man being moued and ſtirred vp by God, doth not cooperate by yeelding to God, ſo ſtirring and calling him, whereby he may diſpoſe and prepare himſelfe to obtaine the grace of juſtification, and that hee cannot diſſent, if hee liſt; let him be accurſed. So in the firſt act of regeneration, it makes mans will a co-worker with Gods grace, and giues the will a power to vſe or refuſe this grace offered, (as before I told you of ſtaying and going out of priſon, of curing or not curing of wounds:)
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8070:75"/>whereas <hi>our tenth Article</hi> tell's vs, that the grace of God prevents vs: how? why it ſayth not onely that wee may haue a power, but that we may haue a good will, nor doth it, there leaue vs, but worketh with vs, when we haue the will. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> tenent is much derogatory fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, wich claimes both the will &amp; the deed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and in this point of <hi>free will,</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and <hi>Wee</hi> cannot be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you ſeene how Popery blindes herſelfe in viewing hereſtate of miſery, how ſhe covers her wrinkles &amp; deformities, and ſtops her creviſſes with vntempered morter, if ſhee taught not that <hi>concupiſcence</hi> which is the inmoſt garment of the ſoule, the firſt it puts on and the laſt it puts off, is <hi>no ſinne,</hi> ſhee could not affirme afterwards that any man could performe the Law, or bee juſtified by inherent righteouſneſſe, and if ſhee layd not with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand the ſandy foundation of <hi>free-will,</hi> ſhe could not haue out-faced the world that the <hi>merit</hi> of any man were his owne. So then having play'd her part (as ſhe thinketh) with applauſe in the firſt ſcene of mans life his forlorne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of miſery, ſhe ventures fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that to the ſecond ſcene of his life, his cure &amp; recovery out of his former ſickneſſe by juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Though as yet you ſe ſhe is not ſo good a leech as to find out the extremity of the diſeaſe, yet I wiſh her ſo good lucke, as to light vpon ſome good medicine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it. Hence the queſtion ariſeth betwixt the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and her, whether ſhee muſt looke for nhe Phyſicke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in herſelfe, or whether ſhee muſt looke for it abroad. In a word; the chiefe quarrell is about the <hi>matter of this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,</hi> and the <hi>inſtrument which applyes it. Firſt for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it,</hi> wee agree on both ſides that it is righteouſneſſe, and that this righteousneſſe muſt come from Chriſt. Now the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is either <hi>inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> and eſteemed as ours by reaſon of our faith in him, or elſe <hi>inherent in vs, but proceeding from him</hi> being infuſ'd
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8070:75"/>in our hearts by his grace, which wee call ſanctification. The difference lyes in this. The <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> makes the matter of this cure, that is, which workes our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from death, and purchaſeth everlaſting life, to bee <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe inherent in vs,</hi> which conſiſts <hi>partly of habituall righteouſneſſe,</hi> to wit, grace and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity diffuſed into our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, as wee find it <hi>in the</hi> 6 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>ſeſſion, and the</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>canon: partly of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all righteouſneſſe,</hi> to wit, good workes flowing from the former, as it is <hi>in the ſame ſeſſion and</hi> 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>can.</hi> By reaſon of the former of theſe, ſay the Schoole-men, wee obtaine the <hi>firſt juſtification,</hi> having heaven made due vnto vs by title of inheritance; by the latter wee obtaine a <hi>ſecond juſtification,</hi> that is, wee do corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and encreaſe the former, laying right to heaven by title of merit: Contrariwiſe <hi>our</hi> 11 <hi>Article</hi> tells vs, that wee are accounted righteous before God onely for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, by faith: and not for our owne workes and deſervings. I might then reaſon here with Saint <hi>Paul, if wee are accounted righteous, then it's of grace, not of debt,</hi> if onely for the merit of Chriſt, then not for our inherent righteouſneſſe, if not for our owne workes and deſervings, then certainely not for any habituall or actuall juſtice that is in vs: But here our <hi>peace-makers</hi> do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeeing that both ſides do agree that wee are abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our ſinnes, and delivered from Hell, originally by the blood or Ieſus Chriſt, what doth it import vs whether another pay our debts for vs, as the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> teacheth, or that hee giue vs mony in our hands to pay it our ſelues, as the <hi>Papiſt</hi> affirmes, are not both alike behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him? I anſwere, it is true if it be firſt proued, that he doth giue it vs in our hands: for otherwiſe when wee thinke our ſelues rich, and venture to purchaſe a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lordſhip, if wee haue no money to pay for it, happily
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8070:76"/>wee may go without it: Againe it muſt bee proved, that wee are able to receiue this mony into our hands, if hee ſhould giue it vs: ſuppoſe one ſhould ſee a citty, which hee is deſirous to bee Lord of, the which the owners va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at the price of many millions, the party beeing deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of mony, begges of ſome great Prince, whoſe favour hee is in, to giue him ſo much out of his treaſury, to pay for this citty, as the ſumme amounts vnto; the Prince giues it him, and by this meanes, the partie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Lord and Maſter of the citty: but how? doth the Prince giue all theſe millions into his hands, or lay them vpon his backe? why the burthen were vnſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and his hand vncapable to hold ſo great a maſſe; therefore hee brings the ſellers to the place where it lyes, and there ſhewes them, where it is, and that way giues it them. So it is in the worke of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and in the purchaſſing everlaſting life: the price of it is infinite, it coſt the death of him which was God and man, to gaine it for vs; if hee had beene God onely, and not man, hee could not haue ſuffered for vs, and if hee had beene man onely, and not God, his ſufferings had not beene of ſo great a vertue, as to merit for vs, ſo goodly an inheritance; now is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that hee which is God as well as man (that hee might bee capable of ſuch a merit) ſhould make vs againe (which are but men and ſinfull men, and not Gods) capable of this merit; why, ſurely wee dare not ſay, that wee are able to carry all thoſe millions, which muſt bee payed for our celeſtiall Citty, in our pockets, as do the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but wee muſt bring the Lord of it to our treaſury, Chriſt Ieſus, and bid him take from thence what will ſatisfie him. Thus you ſee, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Wee</hi> do yet differ about <hi>the matter of our cure, or juſtification:</hi> and in this wee cannot bee reconciled.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8070:76"/>Let's now come to the inſtrument whereby the playſter is applyed to the wound. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> affirme, that it is applied by habituall and actuall righteouſneſſe. But yet amongſt theſe, they allow faith a ſhare; wee ſay on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, that faith onely doth apply it, but yet not that faith which is alone, without inherent righteouſneſſe habituall and actuall; ſo that, ſay our <hi>truce-makers,</hi> for ſo much as the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt</hi> doe both holde, faith and good workes to bee neceſſary for thoſe which are ſaved, it ſeemes they agree vpon the ſame roote CHRIST IESVS, vpon the ſame tree, ſpringing and receiving nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from its roote, faith and workes; the difference is onely in the boughes, which wee muſt holde by: the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (ſay they) layes holde of a ſure one, which will holde, it is faith in CHRIST; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for more ſecurity lay holde on both, faith in CHRIST, and workes; ſeeing then it is but ſo, that both may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their holde; why ſhould wee ſo wrangle about trifles? I anſwere, that the reaſon holdes not, vnleſſe we conceiue faith and workes to bee two firme boughes, equally growing out of the ſame body, whereon one might hang; now faith (I confeſſe) is a firme bough, whereon wee may ſafely venture; but workes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſſe, is not another bough equalling faith, but a tender and weake twigge, blaſted and halfe withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſprouting out of the bough which is called faith: So that hee which ſhall hang vpon it, ſhall certainely fall downe. Againe, that faith which wee reſt vpon, is a bough of the tree, which wee may put confidence in, and and may bee bolde to relye vpon: their faith is not the ſame bough (as men would make vs beleeue) but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bough, wanting ſappe, and juyce, and ſtrength, ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with tempeſts, and ſhaken with winde and weather, vpon which they forbid any man to lay his aſſurance, and indeed which cannot ſaue them: marke but the difference;

I will now come to the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, which the</hi> 19. <hi>Article,</hi> makes to bee the <hi>ſecond note.</hi> Wherein (for brevities ſake) I will giue you onely a taſte, and that ſhall bee in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper.</hi> Wee agree on both ſides, that CHRIST is really preſent in the Sacrament, the queſtion is about the <hi>manner</hi> of it.

Secondly <hi>affirmatiuely,</hi> how Chriſt is there, to wit, after an heauenly and ſpirituall manner, and receiued and eaten by faith; Afterwards, whereas <hi>the Councell of Trent</hi> would haue vs to worſhip this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with divine worſhip, the 31. <hi>Artic.</hi> of ours, well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaines, that theſe ſacrifices of <hi>Maſſes</hi> were blaſphemous fables, &amp; dangerous conceits; Now if by the cenſure of <hi>our Church,</hi>

            <p>What can the <hi>truce-makers</hi> then here object for their purpoſe? will they ſay our differences doe conſiſt in <hi>nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and meere <hi>ſubtilties?</hi> is this a <hi>nicety?</hi> to know whence we are to be aſſured of our faith, which we beleeue; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the <hi>Canonicall Scripture,</hi> or out of the <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> writings and <hi>traditions?</hi> or is it a <hi>meere ſubtilty,</hi> &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the maintaining of a Chriſtian, whether we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Idolatry</hi> or no, in receiving the <hi>Sacraments?</hi> how wee are wounded in <hi>nature,</hi> and deſpoiled of <hi>grace;</hi> and againe, by what meanes we muſt be ſaved from deſtruction?

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8070:78"/>them in all other points, yet if wee doe not ſubject our ſelues to them in this; that we acknowledge the <hi>Pope</hi> for <hi>Peter's ſucceſſour,</hi> and <hi>the Head of the Church,</hi> wee yet are <hi>Heretickes,</hi> and no members of the true Church, (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his 3. Booke <hi>de membris Eccleſiae, Chap</hi> 19.) This <hi>ſupremacy of the Pope</hi> is ſuch <hi>an Article of their faith,</hi> that to defend it, and over-ſhaddow it, there is nothing which the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> leaues vnattempted; ſo that to retaine it, it paſſeth not to forgoe halfe her controverſies, yea to renounce the holy Scriptures, and the Articles of all the Creeds: <hi>For the dead,</hi> you may chooſe whether you will <hi>pray</hi> for them; <hi>for Saints</hi> if you will, you ſhall not bee compelled to <hi>pray</hi> to them; <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> and <hi>vowes</hi> you may bee diſpenſed with; in all which, and more, the holy Fathers will beare with their weake Catholiques. Turne over a new leafe, &amp; albeit thou beeſt a good Catholique, yet if thou ſayeſt vnto them, <hi>Father,</hi> I doubt ſomewhat of the <hi>preheminence of the Pope,</hi> and of his <hi>Monarchie,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath ſo large an extent, as ſome make it to haue; theſe termes of his being <hi>God's-Vicegerent,</hi> and of his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,</hi> doe wound my conſcience; they are ſtreight in an vproare; <hi>an inexpiable blaſphemy,</hi> and <hi>an Anathema:</hi> If thou think'ſt but to dull the edge of this blade, or bend this temporall ſword, if thou receiu'ſt not the thruſt of it with thy naked breaſt, thou art a dead man; hadſt thou faith enough to remoue mountaines from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; hadſt thou as much charity as to ſuffer thy ſelfe to be burnt for thy brethren, yet the <hi>Ocean,</hi> were it turn'd all into <hi>holy-water,</hi> could not ſaue thee, there's no peace for thee in this life, nor remiſsion in the world to come. Much more might be ſaid, concerning the vnreconcileable differences betweene <hi>Vs</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> but the many liues ſpent in the quarrell, even of thoſe which held right deare amity, and concord, the <hi>conſtant opinion</hi> on both ſides, <hi>our Soveraigne's heroicall Defiance to Rome,</hi> in his Writings,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8070:79"/>proclaiming the <hi>Pope, Antichriſt,</hi> prevailes ſo farre with you, I doubt not, as that I ſhall not neede to inſiſt any longer vpon a point ſo plaine &amp; evident: Now he which brought vs out of darkneſſe into light, open our eyes, that we may diſcerne light from darkneſſe; and that now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the children of th'one, wee fall not backe to bee the ſervants of the other, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: To him therefore, with the Father, and Holy Ghoſt, one GOD and three Perſons, bee rendred all praiſe, honour, and glory, now and for evermore.
